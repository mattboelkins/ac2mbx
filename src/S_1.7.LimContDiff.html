In <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html" alt="Section 1.2 The notion of limit" title="Section 1.2 The notion of limit">Section 1.2</a>, we learned about how the concept of limits can be used to study the trend of a function near a fixed input value. As we study such trends, we are fundamentally interested in knowing how well-behaved the function is at the given point, say \(x = a\). In this present section, we aim to expand our perspective and develop language and understanding to quantify how the function acts and how its value changes near a particular point. Beyond thinking about whether or not the function has a limit \(L\) at \(x = a\), we will also consider the value of the function \(f(a)\) and how this value is related to \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\), as well as whether or not the function has a derivative \(f'(a)\) at the point of interest. Throughout, we will build on and formalize ideas that we have encountered in several settings.

We begin to consider these issues through the following preview activity that asks you to consider the graph of a function with a variety of interesting behaviors.

Use the graph to answer each of the following questions. Note: to the right of \(x = 2\), the graph of \(f\) is exhibiting infinite oscillatory behavior similar to the function \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})\) that we encountered in the key example early in <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html" alt="Section 1.2 The notion of limit" title="Section 1.2 The notion of limit">Section 1.2</a>.

<span class="type">Subsection</span><span class="codenumber">1.7.2</span><span class="title">Having a limit at a point</span>
</h1></header><p id="p-232">
In <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html" alt="Section 1.2 The notion of limit" title="Section 1.2 The notion of limit">Section 1.2</a>, we first encountered limits and learned that we say that \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) and write \(\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L\) provided that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal to) \(a\). Here, we expand further on this definition and focus in more depth on what it means for a function not to have a limit at a given value.
</p>
<p id="p-233">
Essentially there are two behaviors that a function can exhibit at a point where it fails to have a limit. In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.NoLimit.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.NoLimit" alt="Figure 1.7.2 " title="Figure 1.7.2 ">Figure 1.7.2</a>, at left we see a function \(f\) whose graph shows a jump at \(a = 1\). In particular, if we let \(x\) approach 1 from the left side, the value of \(f\) approaches 2, while if we let \(x\) go to \(1\) from the right, the value of \(f\) tends to 3. Because the value of \(f\) does not approach a single number as \(x\) gets arbitrarily close to 1 from both sides, we know that \(f\) does not have a limit at \(a = 1\).
</p>
<p id="p-234">
Since \(f\) does approach a single value on each side of \(a = 1\), we can introduce the notion of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>left</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>right</em> (or <!--Style me with CSS--><em>one-sided</em>) limits. \knownindex{\lt main&gt;left limit\lt /main&gt;} \knownindex{\lt main&gt;right limit\lt /main&gt;} \knownindex{\lt main&gt;limit\lt /main&gt;\lt sub&gt;one-sided\lt /sub&gt;} We say that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>\(f\) has limit \(L_1\) as \(x\) approaches \(a \) from the left</em> and write
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-48">\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L_1
\]</span><p id="p-235">
provided that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L_1\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\) while always having \(x \lt  a\). In this case, we call \(L_1\) the left-hand limit of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\). Similarly, we say <!--Style me with CSS--><em>\(L_2\) is the right-hand limit of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\)</em> and write
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-49">\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L_2
\]</span><p id="p-236">
provided that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L_2\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\) while always having \(x &gt; a\). In the graph of the function \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.NoLimit.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.NoLimit" alt="Figure 1.7.2 " title="Figure 1.7.2 ">Figure 1.7.2</a>, we see that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-50">\[
\lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = 2 \ \ \mbox{and}  \ \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = 3
\]</span><p id="p-237">
and precisely because the left and right limits are not equal, the overall limit of \(f\) as \(x \to 1\) fails to exist.
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="F_1.7.NoLimit"><img width="100%" src="images/1_7_NoLimit.png"><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">1.7.2</span>Functions \(f\) and \(g\) that each fail to have a limit at \(a = 1\).</figcaption></figure><p id="p-238">
For the function \(g\) pictured at right in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.NoLimit.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.NoLimit" alt="Figure 1.7.2 " title="Figure 1.7.2 ">Figure 1.7.2</a>, the function fails to have a limit at \(a = 1\) for a different reason. While the function does not have a jump in its graph at \(a = 1\), it is still not the case that \(g\) approaches a single value as \(x\) approaches 1. In particular, due to the infinitely oscillating behavior of \(g\) to the right of \(a = 1\), we say that the right-hand limit of \(g\) as \(x \to 1^+\) does not exist, and thus
\(\ds \lim_{x \to 1} g(x) \ \mbox{does not exist} .\)
</p>
<p id="p-239">
To summarize, anytime either a left- or right-hand limit fails to exist or the left- and right-hand limits are not equal to each other, the overall limit will not exist. Said differently,
</p>
<p id="p-240">

<p id="p-246">
Intuitively, a function is continuous if we can draw it without ever lifting our pencil from the page. Alternatively, we might say that the graph of a continuous function has no jumps or holes in it. We first consider three specific situations in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.Cont.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.Cont" alt="Figure 1.7.5 " title="Figure 1.7.5 ">Figure 1.7.5</a> where all three functions have a limit at \(a = 1\), and then work to make the idea of continuity more precise.
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="F_1.7.Cont"><img width="100%" src="images/1_7_Cont.png"><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">1.7.5</span>Functions \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\) that demonstrate subtly different behaviors at \(a = 1\).</figcaption></figure><p id="p-247">
Note that \(f(1)\) is not defined, which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of \(f\) at \(a = 1\). We will naturally say that \(f\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not continuous at \(a = 1\)</em>. For the next function \(g\) in in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.Cont.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.Cont" alt="Figure 1.7.5 " title="Figure 1.7.5 ">Figure 1.7.5</a>, we observe that while \(\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 3\), the value of \(g(1) = 2\), and thus the limit does not equal the function value. Here, too, we will say that \(g\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not continuous</em>, even though the function is defined at \(a = 1\). Finally, the function \(h\) appears to be the most well-behaved of all three, since at \(a = 1\) its limit and its function value agree. That is,
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-59">\[
\lim_{x \to 1} h(x) = 3 = h(1).
\]</span><p id="p-248">
With no hole or jump in the graph of \(h\) at \(a = 1\), we desire to say that \(h\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>continuous</em> there.
</p>
<p id="p-249">
More formally, we make the following definition.
</p>
<article class="definition-like" id="definition-7"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="codenumber">1.7.6</span>

<p id="p-250">

</ol></article><p id="p-251">
Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c), but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance. In words, (c) essentially says that a function is continuous at \(x = a\) provided that its limit as \(x \to a\) exists and equals its function value at \(x = a\). If a function is continuous at every point in an interval \([a,b]\), we say the function is “continuous on \([a,b]\).” If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, we simply say the function is “continuous.” Thus, continuous functions are particularly nice: to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point, all we need to do is evaluate the function.
</p>
<p id="p-252">
For example, consider \(p(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3\). It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number, and thus if we would like to know \(\lim_{x \to 2} p(x)\), we simply compute
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-60">\[
\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 - 2x + 3) = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 3.
\]</span><p id="p-253">
This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works anytime we know function being considered is continuous. Besides polynomial functions, all exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions are continuous at every point, as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.

</p>
<p id="p-256">
We recall that a function \(f\) is said to be differentiable at \(x = a\) whenever \(f'(a)\) exists. Moreover, for \(f'(a)\) to exist, we know that the function \(y = f(x)\) must have a tangent line at the point \((a,f(a))\), since \(f'(a)\) is precisely the slope of this line. In order to even ask if \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\), it is necessary that \(f\) be continuous at \(x = a\): if \(f\) fails to have a limit at \(x = a\), if \(f(a)\) is not defined, or if \(f(a)\) does not equal the value of \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\), then it doesn't even make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.
</p>
<p id="p-257">
Indeed, it can be proved formally that if a function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), then it must be continuous at \(x = a\). So, if \(f\) is not continuous at \(x = a\), then it is automatically the case that \(f\) is not differentiable there. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.Cont.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.Cont" alt="Figure 1.7.5 " title="Figure 1.7.5 ">Figure 1.7.5</a> from our early discussion of continuity, both \(f\) and \(g\) fail to be differentiable at \(x = 1\) because neither function is continuous at \(x = 1\). But can a function fail to be differentiable at a point where the function is continuous?
</p>
<p id="p-258">
In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.NotDiff.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.NotDiff" alt="Figure 1.7.9 " title="Figure 1.7.9 ">Figure 1.7.9</a>, we revisit the situation where a function has a sharp corner at a point, something we encountered several times in <a href="S_1.4.DerivativeFxn.html" alt="Section 1.4 The derivative function" title="Section 1.4 The derivative function">Section 1.4</a>. For the pictured function \(f\), we observe that \(f\) is clearly continuous at \(a = 1\), since \(\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = 1 = f(1).\)
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="F_1.7.NotDiff"><img width="100%" src="images/1_7_NotDiff.png"><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">1.7.9</span>A function \(f\) that is continuous at \(a = 1\) but not differentiable at \(a = 1\); at right, we zoom in on the point \((1,1)\) in a magnified version of the box in the left-hand plot.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-259">
But the function \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.NotDiff.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.NotDiff" alt="Figure 1.7.9 " title="Figure 1.7.9 ">Figure 1.7.9</a> is not differentiable at \(a = 1\) because \(f'(1)\) fails to exist. One way to see this is to observe that \(f'(x) = -1\) for every value of \(x\) that is less than 1, while \(f'(x) = +1\) for every value of \(x\) that is greater than 1. That makes it seem that either \(+1\) or \(-1\) would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at \(x = 1\). Alternately, we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute \(f'(1)\), and discover that the derivative does not exist. A similar problem will be investigated in <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.7.3.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.7.3" alt="Exercise 1.7.10 " title="Exercise 1.7.10 ">Activity 1.7.10</a>. Finally, we can also see visually that the function \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.NotDiff.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.NotDiff" alt="Figure 1.7.9 " title="Figure 1.7.9 ">Figure 1.7.9</a> does not have a tangent line. When we zoom in on \((1,1)\) on the graph of \(f\), no matter how closely we examine the function, it will always look like a “V”, and never like a single line, which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.
</p>
<p id="p-260">
To make a more general observation, if a function does have a tangent line at a given point, when we zoom in on the point of tangency, the function and the tangent line should appear essentially indistinguishable<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-7" id="fn-7"><sup> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-7" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">See, for instance, \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/6J}{<tt class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/6J</tt>} for an applet (due to David Austin, GVSU) where zooming in shows the increasing similarity between the tangent line and the curve.</span></span>. Conversely, if we have a function such that when we zoom in on a point the function looks like a single straight line, then the function should have a tangent line there, and thus be differentiable. Hence, a function that is differentiable at \(x = a\) will, up close, look more and more like its tangent line at \((a,f(a))\), and thus we say that a function is differentiable at \(x = a\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>locally linear</em>. \knownindex{\lt main&gt;locally linear\lt /main&gt;}

<p id="p-261">

\item A function \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x \to a\) if and only if \(f\) has a left-hand limit at \(x = a\), has a right-hand limit at \(x = a\), and the left- and right-hand limits are equal. Visually, this means that there can be a hole in the graph at \(x = a\), but the function must approach the same single value from either side of \(x = a\).
\item A function \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\) whenever \(f(a)\) is defined, \(f\) has a limit as \(x \to a\), and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree. This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of \(f\) at \(x = a\).
\item A function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\) whenever \(f'(a)\) exists, which means that \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\) and thus \(f\) is locally linear at the value \(x = a\). Informally, this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at \((a,f(a))\) and that there is not a corner point or cusp at \((a,f(a))\).
\item Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at \(x = a\), being continuous at \(x = a\), and being differentiable at \(x = a\)), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), then \(f\) is also continuous at \(x = a\), and if \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\), then \(f\) has a limit at \(x = a\).
