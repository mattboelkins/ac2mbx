<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
Many important sequences are generated through the process of addition. In Preview <xref ref="PA_8.2">Activity</xref>, we see a particular example of a special type of sequence that is connected to a sum.
</p>
  <paragraphs xml:id="PA_8.2"><title>Preview Activity</title>
<p>
Warfarin is an anticoagulant that prevents blood clotting; often it is prescribed to stroke victims in order to help ensure blood flow. The level of warfarin has to reach a certain concentration in the blood in order to be effective.
</p>
  
<p>
Suppose warfarin is taken by a particular patient in a 5 mg dose each day. The drug is absorbed by the body and some is excreted from the system between doses. Assume that at the end of a 24 hour period, 8<percent /> of the drug remains in the body. Let <m>Q(n)</m> be the amount (in mg) of warfarin in the body before the <m>(n+1)</m>st dose of the drug is administered.
</p>
  <ol><li>Explain why <m>Q(1) = 5 \times 0.08</m> mg.</li>
<li>Explain why <m>Q(2) = (5+Q(1)) \times 0.08</m> mg. Then show that 

<me>
Q(2) = (5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08\right) \text{ mg} .
</me>
</li>
<li>Explain why <m>Q(3) = (5+Q(2)) \times 0.08</m> mg. Then show that

<me>
Q(3) = (5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2\right) \text{ mg} .
</me>
</li>
<li>Explain why <m>Q(4) = (5+Q(3)) \times 0.08</m> mg. Then show that

<me>
Q(4) = (5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3\right) \text{ mg} .
</me>
</li>
<li>There is a pattern that you should see emerging. Use this pattern to find a formula for <m>Q(n)</m>, where <m>n</m> is an arbitrary positive integer.</li>
<li>Complete <xref ref="T_8.2_Warfarin">Table</xref> with values of <m>Q(n)</m> for the provided <m>n</m>-values (reporting <m>Q(n)</m> to 10 decimal places). What appears to be happening to the sequence <m>Q(n)</m> as <m>n </m> increases?

<title>Geometric Sums</title>
<p>
In Preview <xref ref="PA_8.2">Activity</xref> we encountered the sum
</p>
  
<me>
(5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right).
</me>
 
<p>
In order to evaluate the long-term level of Warfarin in the patient's system, we will want to fully understand the sum in this expression. This sum has the form
</p>
  
<men xml:id="eq_8.2_part_sum_geometric_1" >
 a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}
</men>
 
<p>
where <m>a=5 \times 0.08</m> and <m>r=0.08</m>. Such a sum is called a <em>geometric sum</em>\knownindex{\lt main>geometric sum\lt /main>} with ratio <m>r</m>. We will analyze this sum in more detail in the next activity.
</p>
  
<exercise xml:id="x8.2.Act1"><statement>
<p>

</me>
 
<p>
In this activity we will find a shortcut formula for <m>S_n</m> that does not involve a sum of <m>n</m> terms.

 </ol>  </statement>
</solution>
  
<p>
We can summarize the result of <xref ref="x8.2.Act1">Activity</xref> in the following way.
</p>
  
<p>

{
A geometric sum <m>S_n</m> is a sum of the form
</p>
  
<men xml:id="eq_8.2_geometric_sum" >
 S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1},
</men>
 
<p>
where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 1</m>. The geometric sum <m>S_n</m> can be written more simply as
</p>
  
<men xml:id="eq_8.2_part_sum_geometric" >
 S_n = a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}.
</men>
 
<p>
} 

</p>
  
<p>
We now apply equation <xref ref="eq_8.2_part_sum_geometric" /> to the example involving warfarin from Preview <xref ref="PA_8.2">Activity</xref>. Recall that
</p>
  
<me>
Q(n)=(5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right) \text{ mg} ,
</me>
 
<p>
so <m>Q(n)</m> is a geometric sum with <m>a=5 \times 0.08 = 0.4</m> and <m>r = 0.08</m>. Thus,
</p>
  
<me>
Q(n) = 0.4\left(\frac{1-0.08^n}{1-0.08}\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right).
</me>
 
<p>
Notice that as <m>n</m> goes to infinity, the value of <m>0.08^n</m> goes to 0. So,
</p>
  
<me>
\lim_{n \to \infty} Q(n) = \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \approx 0.435.
</me>
 
<p>
Therefore, the long-term level of Warfarin in the blood under these conditions is <m>\frac{1}{2.3}</m>, which is approximately 0.435 mg.
</p>
  
<p>
To determine the long-term effect of Warfarin, we considered a geometric sum of <m>n</m> terms, and then considered what happened as <m>n</m> was allowed to grow without bound. In this sense, we were actually interested in an infinite geometric sum (the result of letting <m>n</m> go to infinity in the finite sum). We call such an infinite geometric sum a <em>geometric series</em>. \knownindex{\lt main>geometric series\lt /main>} \knownindex{\lt main>series\lt /main>\lt sub>geometric\lt /sub>}
</p>
  
<definition><statement>
<p>
A geometric series is an infinite sum of the form
</p>
  
<men xml:id="eq_8.2_geometric_series" >
 a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n.
</men>
 </statement>
</definition>
 
<p>
The value of <m>r</m> in the geometric series <xref ref="eq_8.2_geometric_series" /> is called the <em>common ratio</em> \knownindex{\lt main>geometric series\lt /main>\lt sub>common ratio\lt /sub>} of the series because the ratio of the (<m>n+1</m>)st term <m>ar^n</m> to the <m>n</m>th term <m>ar^{n-1}</m> is always <m>r</m>.
</p>
  
<p>
Geometric series are very common in mathematics and arise naturally in many different situations. As a familiar example, suppose we want to write the number with repeating decimal expansion
</p>
  
<me>
N=0.1212\overline{12}
</me>
 
<p>
as a rational number.
Observe that
</p>
  
<md><mrow>N \amp =  0.12 + 0.0012 + 0.000012 + \cdots</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots,</mrow>
 
</md>
 
<p>
which is an infinite geometric series with <m>a=\frac{12}{100}</m> and <m>r = \frac{1}{100}</m>. In the same way that we were able to find a shortcut formula for the value of a (finite) geometric sum, we would like to develop a formula for the value of a (infinite) geometric series. We explore this idea in the following activity.
</p>
  
<exercise xml:id="x8.2.Act2"><statement>

<p>
From our work in <xref ref="x8.2.Act2">Activity</xref>, we can now find the value of the geometric series <m>N = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots.</m> In particular, using <m>a = \frac{12}{100}</m> and <m>r = \frac{1}{100}</m>, we see that
</p>
  
<me>
N = \frac{12}{100} \left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{100}}\right) = \frac{12}{100} \left(\frac{100}{99}\right) = \frac{4}{33}.
</me>
  
<p>
It is important to notice that a geometric sum is simply the sum of a finite number of terms of a geometric series. In other words, the geometric sum <m>S_n</m> for the geometric series
</p>
  
<me>
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k
</me>
 
<p>
is
</p>
  
<me>
S_n = a+ar+ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k.
</me>
 
<p>
We also call this sum <m>S_n</m> the <m>n</m>th <em>partial sum</em>\knownindex{\lt main>partial sum\lt /main>} of the geometric series. We summarize our recent work with geometric series as follows.
</p>
  
<p>

{
</p>
  <ul><li>A geometric series is an infinite sum of the form

<men xml:id="eq_8.2_geometric_series_2" >
 a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n,

where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 0</m>.</li>
<li>The <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> of the geometric series is

<me>
S_n = a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}.
</me>
</li>
<li>If <m>|r| \lt  1</m>, then using the fact that <m>S_n = a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}</m>, it follows that the sum <m>S</m> of the geometric series <xref ref="eq_8.2_geometric_series_2" /> is

<me>
S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}

 </ul>

</p>
  
<exercise xml:id="x8.2.Act3"><statement>
<p>
The formulas we have derived for the geometric series and its partial sum so far have assumed we begin indexing our sums at <m>n=0</m>. If instead we have a sum that does not begin at <m>n=0</m>, we can factor out common terms and use our established formulas. This process is illustrated in the examples in this activity.

\item Suppose you drop a golf ball onto a hard surface from a height <m>h</m>. The collision with the ground causes the ball to lose energy and so it will not bounce back to its original height. The ball will then fall again to the ground, bounce back up, and continue. Assume that at each bounce the ball rises back to a height <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> of the height from which it dropped. Let <m>h_n</m> be the height of the ball on the <m>n</m>th bounce, with <m>h_0 = h</m>.

\item The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like <q><m>k</m> million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of <m>n</m> billion of dollars.</q> Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75<percent /> of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals <m>P</m> dollars for each person.
</p>
  <ol><li>The tax cut of <m>P</m> dollars is income for its recipient. How much of this tax cut will be spent?


<solution><statement>
<p>
Given that 75<percent /> of income is spent, this tax cut/rebate will result in <m>0.75P</m> dollars spent.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>In this simple model, we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn, spends 75<percent /> of this income. After this ``second round" of spent income, how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut/rebate?


<solution><statement>
<p>
The amount of money introduced into the economy is the amount <m>0.75P</m> after the original cut plus 75<percent /> of that income from spending. So the total amount of money added to the economy is
</p>
  
<me>
0.75P + 0.75(0.75P) = 0.75P(1+0.75)
</me>
 
<p>
dollars.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75<percent /> of this income, and so on. In economics this is called the <em>multiplier effect</em>. Explain why an original tax cut/rebate of <m>P</m> dollars will result in multiplied spending of

<me>
0.75P(1+0.75+0.75^2+ \cdots ).
</me>
 
dollars.


<solution><statement>
<p>
The <m>n-1</m>st round of spending will result in income of <m>0.75^nP</m> dollars, of which <m>75\%</m> or <m>0.75^{n+1}P</m> will be spent. So each round of spending adds a factor to the total amount, giving us a total amount of spending in the economy of
</p>
  
<me>
0.75P + 0.75^2P + 0.75^2P + \cdots = 0.75P(1+0.75+0.75^2+ \cdots )
</me>
 
<p>
dollars.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Based on these assumptions, how much stimulus will a 200 billion dollar tax cut/rebate to consumers add to the economy, assuming consumer spending remains consistent forever.


<solution><statement>
<p>
Using the sum of a geometric series with ratio <m>0.75</m> shows that

\item Like stimulus packages, home mortgages and foreclosures also impact the economy. A problem for many borrowers is the adjustable rate mortgage, in which the interest rate can change (and usually increases) over the duration of the loan, causing the monthly payments to increase beyond the ability of the borrower to pay. Most financial analysts recommend fixed rate loans, ones for which the monthly payments remain constant throughout the term of the loan. In this exercise we will analyze fixed rate loans.
</p>
  
<p>
When most people buy a large ticket item like car or a house, they have to take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. With a loan, we borrow money, say <m>P</m> dollars (called the principal), and pay off the loan at an interest rate of <m>r</m><percent />. To pay back the loan we make regular monthly payments, some of which goes to pay off the principal and some of which is charged as interest. In most cases, the interest is computed based on the amount of principal that remains at the beginning of the month. We assume a fixed rate loan, that is one in which we make a constant monthly payment <m>M</m> on our loan, beginning in the original month of the loan.
</p>
  
<p>
Suppose you want to buy a house. You have a certain amount of money saved to make a down payment, and you will borrow the rest to pay for the house. Of course, for the privilege of loaning you the money, the bank will charge you interest on this loan, so the amount you pay back to the bank is more than the amount you borrow. In fact, the amount you ultimately pay depends on three things: the amount you borrow (called the <em>principal</em>), the interest rate, and the length of time you have to pay off the loan plus interest (called the <em>duration</em> of the loan). For this example, we assume that the interest rate is fixed at <m>r</m><percent />.
</p>
  
<p>
To pay off the loan, each month you make a payment of the same amount (called <em>installments</em>). Suppose we borrow <m>P</m> dollars (our principal) and pay off the loan at an interest rate of <m>r</m><percent /> with regular monthly installment payments of <m>M</m> dollars. So in month 1 of the loan, before we make any payments, our principal is <m>P</m> dollars. Our goal in this exercise is to find a formula that relates these three parameters to the time duration of the loan.
</p>
  
<p>
We are charged interest every month at an annual rate of <m>r</m><percent />, so each month we pay <m>\frac{r}{12}</m><percent /> interest on the principal that remains. Given that the original principal is <m>P</m> dollars, we will pay <m>\left(\frac{0.0r}{12}\right)P</m> dollars in interest on our first payment. Since we paid <m>M</m> dollars in total for our first payment, the remainder of the payment (<m>M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P</m>) goes to pay down the principal. So the principal remaining after the first payment (let's call it <m>P_1</m>) is the original principal minus what we paid on the principal, or
</p>
  
<me>
P_1 = P - \left( M - \left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P\right) = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P - M.
</me>
 
<p>
As long as <m>P_1</m> is positive, we still have to keep making payments to pay off the loan.
</p>
  <ol><li>Recall that the amount of interest we pay each time depends on the principal that remains. How much interest, in terms of <m>P_1</m> and <m>r</m>, do we pay in the second installment?


<solution><statement>

<solution><statement>
<p>
\vs
The amount of our payment <m>M</m> that doesn't go toward interest is applied toward the principal. So we reduce our principal by <m>M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_1</m> dollars. Therefore, the balance of our loan after the second installment is
</p>
  
<me>
P_2 = P_1 - \left( M - \left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_1 \right) = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P_1 - M.

For the third payment we are charged <m>\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_2</m> dollars in interest. So <m>M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_2</m> dollars goes toward paying down the principal. Then
