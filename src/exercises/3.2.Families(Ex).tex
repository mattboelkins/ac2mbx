\item Consider the one-parameter family of functions given by $p(x) = x^3-ax^2$, where $a>0$.
\ba
	\item Sketch a plot of a typical member of the family, using the fact that each is a cubic polynomial with a repeated zero at $x = 0$ and another zero at $x = a$.
	\item Find all critical numbers of $p$.
	\item Compute $p''$ and find all values for which $p''(x) = 0$.  Hence construct a second derivative sign chart for $p$.
	\item Describe how the location of the critical numbers and the inflection point of $p$ change as $a$ changes.  That is, if the value of $a$ is increased, what happens to the critical numbers and inflection point?

\item Let $E(x) = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}}$, where $m$ is any real number and $s$ is a positive real number.
\ba
	\item Compute $E'(x)$ and hence find all critical numbers of $E$.
