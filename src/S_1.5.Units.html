An interesting and powerful feature of mathematics is that it can often be thought of both in abstract terms and in applied ones. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of arbitrary functions. At the same time, calculus can also be very directly connected to our experience of physical reality by considering functions that represent meaningful processes. We have already seen that for a position function \(y = s(t)\), say for a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the ball's velocity at time \(t\) is given by \(v(t) = s'(t)\), the derivative of the position function. Further, recall that if \(s(t)\) is measured in feet at time \(t\), the units on \(v(t) = s'(t)\) are feet per second.
</p>
<p id="p-153">
In what follows in this section, we investigate several different functions, each with specific physical meaning, and think about how the units on the independent variable, dependent variable, and the derivative function add to our understanding. To start, we consider the familiar problem of a position function of a moving object.

One of the longest stretches of straight (and flat) road in North America can be found on the Great Plains in the state of North Dakota on state highway 46, which lies just south of the interstate highway I-94 and runs through the town of Gackle. A car leaves town (at time \(t = 0\)) and heads east on highway 46; its position in miles from Gackle at time \(t\) in minutes is given by the graph of the function in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.5.PA1.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.5.PA1" alt="Figure 1.5.1 " title="Figure 1.5.1 ">Figure 1.5.1</a>. Three important points are labeled on the graph; where the curve looks linear, assume that it is indeed a straight line.

As we now know, the derivative of the function \(f\) at a fixed value \(x\) is given by
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-31">\[
f'(x) = \ds \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},
\]</span><p id="p-156">
and this value has several different interpretations. If we set \(x = a\), one meaning of \(f'(a)\) is the slope of the tangent line at the point \((a,f(a))\).
</p>
<p id="p-157">
In alternate notation, we also sometimes equivalently write \(\frac{df}{dx}\) or \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) instead of \(f'(x)\), and these notations helps us to further see the units (and thus the meaning) of the derivative as it is viewed as <!--Style me with CSS--><em>the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\)</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;instantaneous rate of change\lt /main&gt;}. Note that the units on the slope of the secant line, \(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\), are “units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\).” Thus, when we take the limit to get \(f'(x)\), we get these same units on the derivative \(f'(x)\): units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\). Regardless of the function \(f\) under consideration (and regardless of the variables being used), it is helpful to remember that the units on the derivative function are “units of output per unit of input,” in terms of the input and output of the original function.
</p>
<p id="p-158">
For example, say that we have a function \(y = P(t)\), where \(P\) measures the population of a city (in thousands) at the start of year \(t\) (where \(t = 0\) corresponds to 2010 AD), and we are told that \(P'(2) = 21.37\). What is the meaning of this value? Well, since \(P\) is measured in thousands and \(t\) is measured in years, we can say that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2012 is 21.37 thousand people per year. We therefore expect that in the coming year, about 21,370 people will be added to the city's population.

It is also helpful to recall, as we first experienced in <a href="S_1.3.DerivativePt.html" alt="Section 1.3 The derivative of a function at a point" title="Section 1.3 The derivative of a function at a point">Section 1.3</a>, that when we want to estimate the value of \(f'(x)\) at a given \(x\), we can use the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>difference quotient</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;difference quotient\lt /main&gt;} \(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\) with a relatively small value of \(h\). In doing so, we should use both positive and negative values of \(h\) in order to make sure we account for the behavior of the function on both sides of the point of interest. To that end, we consider the following brief example to demonstrate the notion of a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>central difference</em> and its role in estimating derivatives.
</p>\hspace{5.0in}<div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-Ex_1.5.1" id="Ex_1.5.1"><article class="example-like"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Example</span><span class="codenumber">1.5.2</span>

Suppose that \(y = f(x)\) is a function for which three values are known: \(f(1) = 2.5\), \(f(2) = 3.25\), and \(f(3) = 3.625\). Estimate \(f'(2)\).
</p></article></div>
<p id="p-161">
Solution.    
We know that \(f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h}\). But since we don't have a graph for \(y = f(x)\) nor a formula for the function, we can neither sketch a tangent line nor evaluate the limit exactly. We can't even use smaller and smaller values of \(h\) to estimate the limit. Instead, we have just two choices: using \(h = -1\) or \(h = 1\), depending on which point we pair with \((2,3.25)\).
</p>
<p id="p-162">
So, one estimate is
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-32">\[
f'(2) \approx \frac{f(1)-f(2)}{1-2} = \frac{2.5-3.25}{-1} = 0.75.
\]</span><p id="p-163">
The other is
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-33">\[
f'(2) \approx \frac{f(3)-f(2)}{3-2} = \frac{3.625-3.25}{1} = 0.375.
\]</span><p id="p-164">
Since the first approximation looks only backward from the point \((2,3.25)\) and the second approximation looks only forward from \((2,3.25)\), it makes sense to average these two values in order to account for behavior on both sides of the point of interest. Doing so, we find that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-34">\[
f'(2) \approx \frac{0.75 + 0.375}{2} = 0.5625.
\]</span>\hspace{5.0in}<p id="p-165">

Note that this central difference has the exact same value as the average of the forward difference and backward difference (and it is straightforward to explain why this always holds), and moreover that the central difference yields a very good approximation to the derivative's value, in part because the secant line that uses both a point before and after the point of tangency yields a line that is closer to being parallel to the tangent line.

Because at time \(t = 64\) the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at \(t = 65\), the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at \(t = 64\), or in other words \(F(65) \approx 330.28 + 1.341 = 331.621\).  Similarly, at \(t = 66\), two minutes have elapsed from \(t = 64\), so we expect an increase of \(2 \dot 1.341\) degrees:  \(F(66) \approx 330.28 + 2 \cdot 1.341 = 332.962\).</li>
<li id="li-284">Throughout the time interval \([0,90]\), the temperature \(F\) of the potato is increasing.

That is, while the values of \(F\) continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of \(F'\) are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that “the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.”</li>

It is important to remember that when we do so, not only does the scale on the vertical axis often have to change to accurately represent \(f'\), but the units on that axis also differ. For example, suppose that \(P(t) = 400-330e^{-0.03t}\) tells us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of a potato in an oven at time \(t\) in minutes. In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.5.PPprime.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.5.PPprime" alt="Figure 1.5.7 " title="Figure 1.5.7 ">Figure 1.5.7</a>, we sketch the graph of \(P\) on the left and the graph of \(P'\) on the right.

Note how not only are the vertical scales different in size, but different in units, as the units of \(P\) are \(^{\circ}\)F, while those of \(P'\) are \(^{\circ}\)F/min. In all cases where we work with functions that have an applied context, it is helpful and instructive to think carefully about units involved and how they further inform the meaning of our computations.

<p id="p-176">
\item Regardless of the context of a given function \(y=f(x)\), the derivative always measures the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable with respect to the input variable.
\item The units on the derivative function \(y = f'(x)\) are units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\). Again, this measures how fast the output of the function \(f\) changes when the input of the function changes.
\item The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-41">\[
f'(a) \approx \frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h},

and this quantity measures the slope of the secant line to \(y = f(x)\) through the points \((a-h, f(a-h))\) and \((a+h, f(a+h))\). The central difference generates a good approximation of the derivative's value any time we have symmetric data surrounding a point of interest.
\item Knowing the derivative and function values at a single point enables us to estimate other function values nearby. If, for example, we know that \(f'(7) = 2\), then we know that at \(x = 7\), the function \(f\) is increasing at an instantaneous rate of 2 units of output for every one unit of input. Thus, we expect \(f(8)\) to be approximately 2 units greater than \(f(7)\). The value is approximate because we don't know that the rate of change stays the same as \(x\) changes.

<li id="li-331">Suppose that \(h(40000) = 15500\) and \(h(55000) = 13200\).  What is the average rate of change of \(h\) on the interval \([40000,55000]\), and what are the units on this value?</li>
<li id="li-332">In addition to the information given in (a), say that \(h(70000) = 11100\).  Determine the best possible estimate of \(h'(55000)\) and write one sentence to explain the meaning of your result, including units on your answer.</li>
<li id="li-333">Which value do you expect to be greater: \(h'(30000)\) or \(h'(80000)\)?  Why?</li>
<li id="li-334">Write a sentence to describe the long-term behavior of the function \(V = h(m)\), plus another sentence to describe the long-term behavior of \(h'(m)\).  Provide your discussion in practical terms regarding the value of the car and the rate at which that value is changing.</li>
