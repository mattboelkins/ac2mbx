</h1></header><p id="p-836">
In most of our applications of the derivative so far, we have worked in settings where one quantity (often called \(y\)) depends explicitly on another (say \(x\)), and in some way we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which \(y\) changes with respect to \(x\), leading us to compute \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). These settings emphasize how the derivative enables us to quantify how the quantity \(y\) is changing as \(x\) changes at a given \(x\)-value.
</p>
<p id="p-837">
We are next going to consider situations where multiple quantities are related to one another and changing, but where each quantity can be considered an implicit function of the variable \(t\), which represents time. Through knowing how the quantities are related, we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related. For example, suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon in such a way that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. It makes sense that since the balloon's volume and radius are related, by knowing how fast the volume is changing, we ought to be able to relate this rate to how fast the radius is changing. More specifically, can we find how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?
</p>
<p id="p-838">
The following preview activity leads you through the steps to answer this question.
</p>
<article class="paragraphs" id="PA_3.5"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Preview Activity</span></h5>
<p id="p-839">
A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the balloon's diameter is 12 inches? Is the radius changing more rapidly when \(d = 12\) or when \(d = 16\)? Why?
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-1481">Draw several spheres with different radii, and observe that as volume changes, the radius, diameter, and surface area of the balloon also change.</li>
<li id="li-1482">Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius \(r\) is \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\).  Note well that in the setting of this problem, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>both</em>\(V\) and \(r\) are changing as time \(t\) changes, and thus both \(V\) and \(r\) may be viewed as implicit functions of \(t\), with respective derivatives \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\).  
	
	Differentiate both sides of the equation \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\) with respect to \(t\) (using the chain rule on the right) to find a formula for \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) that depends on both \(r\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\).</li>
<li id="li-1483">At this point in the problem, by differentiating we have “related the rates” of change of \(V\) and \(r\).  Recall that we are given in the problem that the balloon is being inflated at a constant <!--Style me with CSS--><em>rate</em> of 20 cubic inches per second.  Is this rate the value of \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) or \(\frac{dV}{dt}\)?  Why?</li>
<li id="li-1484">From part (c), we know the value of \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) at every value of \(t\).  Next, observe that when the diameter of the balloon is 12, we know the value of the radius.  In the equation \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}\), substitute these values for the relevant quantities and solve for the remaining unknown quantity, which is \(\frac{dr}{dt}\).  How fast is the radius changing at the instant \(d = 12\)?</li>
<li id="li-1485">How is the situation different when \(d = 16\)?  When is the radius changing more rapidly, when \(d = 12\) or when \(d = 16\)?</li>

<span class="type">Subsection</span><span class="codenumber">3.5.2</span><span class="title">Related Rates Problems</span>
</h1></header><p id="p-840">
In problems where two or more quantities can be related to one another, and all of the variables involved can be viewed as implicit functions of time, \(t\), we are often interested in how the rates of change of the individual quantities with respect to time are themselves related; we call these <!--Style me with CSS--><em>related rates</em> problems.\knownindex{\lt main&gt;related rates\lt /main&gt;} Often these problems involve identifying one or more key underlying geometric relationships to relate the variables involved. Once we have an equation establishing the fundamental relationship among variables, we differentiate implicitly with respect to time to find connections among the rates of change.
</p>
<p id="p-841">
For example, consider the situation where sand is being dumped by a conveyor belt on a pile so that the sand forms a right circular cone, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.5.ConeEx.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.5.ConeEx" alt="Figure 3.5.1 " title="Figure 3.5.1 ">Figure 3.5.1</a>.
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="F_3.5.ConeEx"><img width="100%" src="images/3_5_ConeEx.png"><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">3.5.1</span>A conical pile of sand.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-842">
As sand falls from the conveyor belt onto the top of the pile, obviously several features of the sand pile will change: the volume of the pile will grow, the height will increase, and the radius will get bigger, too. All of these quantities are related to one another, and the rate at which each is changing is related to the rate at which sand falls from the conveyor.
</p>
<p id="p-843">
The first key steps in any related rates problem involve identifying which variables are changing and how they are related. In the current problem involving a conical pile of sand, we observe that the radius and height of the pile are related to the volume of the pile by the standard equation for the volume of a cone,
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-353">\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h.
\]</span><p id="p-844">
Viewing each of \(V\), \(r\), and \(h\) as functions of \(t\), we can differentiate implicitly to determine an equation that relates their respective rates of change. Taking the derivative of each side of the equation with respect to \(t\),
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-354">\[
\frac{d}{dt}[V] = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right].
\]</span><p id="p-845">
On the left, \(\frac{d}{dt}[V]\) is simply \(\frac{dV}{dt}\). On the right, the situation is more complicated, as both \(r\) and \(h\) are implicit functions of \(t\), hence we have to use the product and chain rules. Doing so, we find that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="md-35">\begin{align*}
\frac{dV}{dt} \amp  = \amp  \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right]\\
\amp  = \amp  \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \frac{d}{dt}[h] + \frac{1}{3} \pi h \frac{d}{dt}[r^2]\\
\amp  = \amp  \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} + \frac{1}{3} \pi h 2r \frac{dr}{dt}
\end{align*}</span><p id="p-846">
Note particularly how we are using ideas from <a href="S_2.7.Implicit.html" alt="Section 2.7 Derivatives of Functions Given Implicitly" title="Section 2.7 Derivatives of Functions Given Implicitly">Section 2.7</a> on implicit differentiation. There we found that when \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\), \(\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y \frac{dy}{dx}\). The exact same thing is occurring here when we compute \(\frac{d}{dt}[r^2] = 2r \frac{dr}{dt}\).
</p>
<p id="p-847">
With our arrival at the equation
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-355">\[

\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} + \frac{2}{3} \pi rh \frac{dr}{dt},

\]</span><p id="p-848">
we have now related the rates of change of \(V\), \(h\), and \(r\). If we are given sufficient information, we may then find the value of one or more of these rates of change at one or more points in time. Say, for instance, that we know the following: (a) sand falls from the conveyor in such a way that the height of the pile is always half the radius, and (b) sand falls from the conveyor belt at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute. With this information given, we can answer questions such as: how fast is the height of the sandpile changing at the moment the radius is 4 feet?
</p>
<p id="p-849">
The information that the height is always half the radius tells us that for all values of \(t\), \(h = \frac{1}{2}r\). Differentiating with respect to \(t\), it follows that \(\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dr}{dt}\). These relationships enable us to relate \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) exclusively to just one of \(r\) or \(h\). Substituting the expressions involving \(r\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) for \(h\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), we now have that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="E_ConeRR">\begin{equation}
 \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \frac{dr}{dt} + \frac{2}{3} \pi r \cdot \frac{1}{2}r \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}.
\label{E_ConeRR}\tag{3.5.1}\end{equation}</span><p id="p-850">
Since sand falls from the conveyor at the constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute, this tells us the value of \(\frac{dV}{dt}\), the rate at which the volume of the sand pile changes. In particular, \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 10\) ft\(^3\)/min. Furthermore, since we are interested in how fast the height of the pile is changing at the instant \(r = 4\), we use the value \(r = 4\) along with \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 10\) in Equation <a knowl="./knowl/E_ConeRR.html" knowl-id="xref-E_ConeRR" alt="Equation 3.5.1 " title="Equation 3.5.1 ">(3.5.1)</a>, and hence find that

With only the value of \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\) remaining unknown, we solve for \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\) and find that \(10 = 8 \pi \left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\), so that

feet per second. Because we were interested in how fast the height of the pile was changing at this instant, we want to know \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) when \(r = 4\). Since \(\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dr}{dt}\) for all values of \(t\), it follows
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-358">\[
\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{r=4} = \frac{5}{8\pi} \approx 0.19894 \ \mbox{ft/min} .

Note particularly how we distinguish between the notations \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) and \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\). The former represents the rate of change of \(r\) with respect to \(t\) at an arbitrary value of \(t\), while the latter is the rate of change of \(r\) with respect to \(t\) at a particular moment, in fact the moment \(r = 4\). While we don't know the exact value of \(t\), because information is provided about the value of \(r\), it is important to distinguish that we are using this more specific data.

<p id="p-854">
The relationship between \(h\) and \(r\), with \(h = \frac{1}{2}r\) for all values of \(t\), enables us to transition easily between questions involving \(r\) and \(h\). Indeed, had we known this information at the problem's outset, we could have immediately simplified our work. Using \(h = \frac{1}{2}r\), it follows that since \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), we can write \(V\) solely in terms of \(r\) to have

V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}h\right) = \frac{1}{6} \pi r^3.

Recognizing familiar geometric configurations is one way that we relate the changing quantities in a given problem. For instance, while the problem in <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.5.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.5.1" alt="Exercise 3.5.2 " title="Exercise 3.5.2 ">Activity 3.5.2</a> is centered on a conical tank, one of the most important observations is that there are two key right triangles present. In another setting, a right triangle might be indicative of an opportunity to take advantage of the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle. But in the conical tank, the fact that the water at any time fills a portion of the tank in such a way that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the most important relationship with which to work. That enables us to write \(r\) in terms of \(h\) and reduce the overall problem to one where the volume of water depends simply on \(h\), and hence to subsequently relate \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt}\). In other situations where a changing angle is involved, a right triangle may offer the opportunity to find relationships among various parts of the triangle using trigonometric functions.

	<img width="100%" src="images/3_5_Act2Soln.png">
</li>
<li id="li-1532">To relate \(\theta\) and \(h\), observe that the tangent function is a good choice, since \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{h}{4000}\), so that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-364">\[

	Differentiating implicitly with respect to \(t\), we find that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-365">\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4000 \sec^2 (\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt}.
\]</span>
</li>
<li id="li-1533">To relate \(z\) and \(h\), the Pythagorean Theorem is natural to consider.  By this famous result, 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-366">\[
h^2 + 4000^2 = z^2.
\]</span>
 
	Differentiating both sides implicitly with respect to \(t\), it follows
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-367">\[
2h \frac{dh}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt},
\]</span>
 
	and thus \(h \frac{dh}{dt} = z \frac{dz}{dt}.\)</li>
<li id="li-1534">Using the given fact that the rocket's speed is 600 ft/sec at the instant it has risen 3000 feet, we know that \(\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = 600\).  Note further in the triangle that when \(h = 3000\), it follows \(z = 5000\), since the base leg of the triangle is constant at 4000, by using the Pythagorean Theorem.  Substituting this information from the instant \(h = 3000\) into the equation that relates the rates of change of \(z\) and \(h\) found in (c), we find that 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-368">\[
2 \cdot 3000 \cdot 600 = 2 \cdot 5000 \cdot \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}.

	Solving for \(\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}\) we have 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-369">\[
\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \ \mbox{feet/sec} .
\]</span>
 
	
	To answer the question about how fast the camera angle is changing, we use the same information but now in the equation we found in (b) that relates the rates of change of \(\theta\) and \(h\):
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-370">\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4000 \sec^2 (\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt}.
\]</span>
 
	Observe that when \(h = 3000\), in the 3000-4000-5000 right triangle, it follows that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{4}{5}\), so \(\sec(\theta) = \frac{5}{4}\).  Thus, using the instantaneous information,
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-371">\[
600 = 4000 \cdot \frac{25}{16} \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000},
\]</span>
 
	and thus
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-372">\[
 \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{6 \cdot 16}{40 \cdot 25} = \frac{12}{125},
\]</span>
 
	which is measured in radians per second.</li>
<li id="li-1535">Recalling that \(2h \frac{dh}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}\), it follows that 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-373">\[
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{z} \frac{dh}{dt}.
\]</span>
 
	Using this equation when \(h = 3000\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 600\) led us to conclude that \(\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot 600 = 360 \ \mbox{feet/sec} \).  If we instead use \(h = 4000\), it follows that \(z = 4000\sqrt{2}\), so that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-374">\[
\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=4000} = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} \cdot 600 \approx 424.26 \ \mbox{feet/sec} .
\]</span>
 
	Indeed, \(\frac{dz}{dt}\) is an increasing function of \(h\), provided that \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is constant, because we can write \(h^2 + 4000^2 = z^2\), so \(z = \sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}\), making
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-375">\[
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} 600.

	It is straightforward to verify that \(\frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}}\) is an increasing function of \(h\).</li>
</ol></span></span><p id="p-863">
In addition to being able to find instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time, we are often able to make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time. For instance, when a conical tank (point down) is filling with water at a constant rate, we naturally intuit that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time. Note how carefully we need to speak: we mean to say that while the depth, \(h\), of the water is increasing, its rate of change \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is decreasing (both as a function of \(t\) and as a function of \(h\)). These observations may often be made by taking the general equation that relates the various rates and solving for one of them, and doing this without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates. For instance, in the conical tank problem in <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.5.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.5.1" alt="Exercise 3.5.2 " title="Exercise 3.5.2 ">Activity 3.5.2</a>, we established that

<span class="displaymath" id="me-376">\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt},
\]</span><p id="p-864">
and hence
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-377">\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{16}{\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}.
\]</span><p id="p-865">
Provided that \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) is constant, it is immediately apparent that as \(h\) gets larger, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) will get smaller, while always remaining positive. Hence, the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.

As pictured in the applet at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9q}{<tt class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/9q</tt>}, a skateboarder who is 6 feet tall rides under a 15 foot tall lamppost at a constant rate of 3 feet per second. We are interested in understanding how fast his shadow is changing at various points in time.

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-1536">Draw an appropriate right triangle that represents a snapshot in time of the skateboarder, lamppost, and his shadow.  Let \(x\) denote the horizontal distance from the base of the lamppost to the skateboarder and \(s\) represent the length of his shadow.  Label these quantities, as well as the skateboarder's height and the lamppost's height on the diagram.</li>
<li id="li-1537">Observe that the skateboarder and the lamppost represent parallel line segments in the diagram, and thus similar triangles are present.  Use similar triangles to establish an equation that relates \(x\) and \(s\).</li>
<li id="li-1538">Use your work in (b) to find an equation that relates \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{ds}{dt}\).</li>
<li id="li-1539">At what rate is the length of the skateboarder's shadow increasing at the instant the skateboarder is 8 feet from the lamppost?</li>
<li id="li-1540">As the skateboarder's distance from the lamppost increases, is his shadow's length increasing at an increasing rate, increasing at a decreasing rate, or increasing at a constant rate?</li>
<li id="li-1541">Which is moving more rapidly:  the skateboarder or the tip of his shadow?  Explain, and justify your answer.</li>

<li id="li-1554">The given information leads us to construct the following diagram:
	<img width="100%" src="images/3_5_Act3Soln.png">
</li>
<li id="li-1555">The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, with legs of length \(6\) and \(s\) is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs (length 15) and horizontal leg of length \(x + s\).  Because the ratios of the lengths of the legs of these two triangles is equal, we have
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-378">\[
\frac{s}{6} = \frac{s+x}{15}.

	Simplifying, we have \(15s = 6s + 6x\), so that \(9s = 2x\), or most simply, \(3s = 2x\).</li>
<li id="li-1556">Differentiating with respect to \(t\), it is immediate that \(3 \frac{ds}{dt} = 2\frac{dx}{dt}\).</li>
<li id="li-1557">Since \(\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{dx}{dt}\), and \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\), it follows \(\frac{ds}{dt} = 2\) for every value of \(t\) (and \(x\)).  Thus, \(\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8} = 2\) feet per second.</li>
<li id="li-1558">Because \(\frac{ds}{dt}\) is constant, the shadow's length is increasing at a constant rate (irrespective of the distance from the skateboarder to the lamppost).</li>
<li id="li-1559">Let \(y\) represent the location of the tip of the shadow, so that \(y = x + s\).  Observe that we can now compute \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) in terms of \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{ds}{dt}\), with \(\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 3 + 2 = 5\) feet/sec, and hence the tip of the shadow is moving more rapidly than the skateboarder himself.</li>

We let \(x\) denote the position of the ball at time \(t\) and \(z\) the distance from the ball to first base, as pictured below.
</p>
<img width="100%" src="images/3_5_Act4Soln1.png"><p id="p-870">
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that \(x^2 + 90^2 = z^2\); differentiating with respect to \(t\), we have
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-379">\[
2x\frac{dx}{dt} = 2z\frac{dz}{dt}.
\]</span><p id="p-871">
At the instant the ball is halfway to third base, we know \(x = 45\) and \(\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 100\). Moreover, by Pythagoras, \(z^2 = 90^2 + 45^2\), so \(z = 45\sqrt{5}\). Thus,
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-380">\[
2 \cdot 45 \cdot 100 = 2 \cdot 45 \sqrt{5} \cdot \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{x = 45},
\]</span><p id="p-872">
so
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-381">\[
\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = \frac{100}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 44.7214 \ \mbox{feet/sec} .
\]</span><p id="p-873">
For the second question, we still let \(x\) represent the ball's position at time \(t\), but now we introduce \(r\) as the runner's position at time \(t\) and let \(s\) be the distance between the runner and the ball. In this setting, as seen in the diagram below,
</p>
<img width="100%" src="images/3_5_Act4Soln2.png"><p id="p-874">
\(x\), \(r\), and \(s\) form the sides of a right triangle, so that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-382">\[
x^2 + r^2 = s^2,
\]</span><p id="p-875">
by the Pythagorean Theorem. Differentiating each side with respect to \(t\), it follows that the three rates of change are related by the equation
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-383">\[
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2r \frac{dr}{dt} = 2s \frac{ds}{dt}.
\]</span><p id="p-876">
We are given that at the instant \(x = 45\), \(r = \frac{90}{8}\), so by Pythagoras, \(s = \frac{45}{4}\sqrt{17}\). In addition, at this same instant we know that \(\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 100\) and \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 30\). Applying this information,
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-384">\[
2 \cdot 45 \cdot 100 + 2 \cdot \frac{45}{4} \cdot 30 = 2 \cdot \frac{45}{4}\sqrt{17} \cdot \left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x = 45}
\]</span><p id="p-877">
and therefore
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-385">\[
\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = \frac{430}{\sqrt{17}} \approx 104.2903 \ \mbox{feet/sec} .
\]</span></span></span><p id="p-878">
\item When two or more related quantities are changing as implicit functions of time, their rates of change can be related by implicitly differentiating the equation that relates the quantities themselves. For instance, if the sides of a right triangle are all changing as functions of time, say having lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), then these quantities are related by the Pythagorean Theorem: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\). It follows by implicitly differentiating with respect to \(t\) that their rates are related by the equation
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-386">\[
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt},
\]</span><p id="p-879">
so that if we know the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) at a particular time, as well as two of the three rates, we can deduce the value of the third.
