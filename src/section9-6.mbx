<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
We have noted at several points in our work with Taylor polynomials and Taylor series that polynomial functions are the simplest possible functions in mathematics, in part because they essentially only require addition and multiplication to evaluate. Moreover, from the point of view of calculus, polynomials are especially nice: we can easily differentiate or integrate any polynomial. In light of our work in <xref ref="S_8.5.Taylor">Section</xref>, we now know that several important non-polynomials have polynomial-like expansions. For example, for any real number <m>x</m>,
</p>
  
<me>
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!} + \cdots.
</me>
 
<p>
As we continue our study of infinite series, there are two settings where other series like the one for <m>e^x</m> arise: one is where we are simply given an expression like
</p>
  
<me>
1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \cdots
</me>
 
<p>
and we seek the values of <m>x</m> for which the expression makes sense, while another is where we are trying to find an unknown function <m>f</m>, and we think about the possibility that the function has expression
</p>
  
<me>
f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_k x^k + \cdots,
</me>
 
<p>
and we try to determine the values of the constants <m>a_0</m>, <m>a_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>. The latter situation is explored in Preview <xref ref="PA_8.6">Activity</xref>.
</p>
  <paragraphs xml:id="PA_8.6"><title>Preview Activity</title>
<p>
In <xref ref="C_7">Chapter</xref>, we learned some of the many important applications of differential equations, and learned some approaches to solve or analyze them. Here, we consider an important approach that will allow us to solve a wider variety of differential equations.
</p>
  
<p>
Let's consider the familiar differential equation from exponential population growth given by
</p>
  
<men xml:id="eq_PA8.6_Resistance_ode" >
 y' = ky,
</men>
 
<p>
where <m>k</m> is the constant of proportionality. While we can solve this differential equation using methods we have already learned, we take a different approach now that can be applied to a much larger set of differential equations. For the rest of this activity, let's assume that <m>k=1</m>. We will use our knowledge of Taylor series to find a solution to the differential equation <xref ref="eq_PA8.6_Resistance_ode" />.
</p>
  
<p>
To do so, we assume that we have a solution <m>y=f(x)</m> and that <m>f(x)</m> has a Taylor series that can be written in the form
</p>
  
<me>
y = f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^k,
</me>
 
<p>
where the coefficients <m>a_k</m> are undetermined. Our task is to find the coefficients.
</p>
  <ol><li>Assume that we can differentiate a power series term by term.  By taking the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and substituting the result into the differential equation <xref ref="eq_PA8.6_Resistance_ode" />, show that the equation

<me>
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} ka_kx^{k-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^{k}
</me>
 
must be satisfied in order for <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^k</m> to be a solution of the DE.

<solution><statement>
<p>
Differentiation term by term gives
</p>
  
<me>
y' = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} ka_kx_{k-1}.
</me>
 
<p>
We then substitute this series into the differential equation <xref ref="eq_PA8.6_Resistance_ode" /> to obtain the equation
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Two series are equal if and only if they have the same coefficients on like power terms. Use this fact to find a relationship between <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_0</m>.


<solution><statement>
<p>
When we write the first few terms of the series on either side of our differential equation we obtain
</p>
  
<me>
a_1 + (2)a_2x + (3)a_3x^2 + (4)a_4x^3 + \cdots + (k+1)a_{k+1}x^{k} + \cdots = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_kx^k + \cdots.
</me>
 
<p>
Equating the constant terms gives us <m>a_1 = a_0</m>.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Now write <m>a_2</m> in terms of <m>a_1</m>. Then write <m>a_2</m> in terms of <m>a_0</m>.


<solution><statement>
<p>
Equating the degree 1 terms gives us <m>2a_2 = a_1</m> or <m>a_2 = \frac{a_1}{2}</m>. Since <m>a_1 = a_0</m>, we have <m>a_2 = \frac{a_0}{2}</m>.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Write <m>a_3</m> in terms of <m>a_2</m>. Then write <m>a_3</m> in terms of <m>a_0</m>.


<solution><statement>
<p>
Equating the degree 2 terms gives us <m>3a_3 = a_2</m> or <m>a_3 = \frac{a_2}{3}</m>. Since <m>a_2 = \frac{a_0}{2}</m>, we have <m>a_3 = \frac{a_0}{3!}</m>.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Write <m>a_4</m> in terms of <m>a_3</m>. Then write <m>a_4</m> in terms of <m>a_0</m>.


<solution><statement>
<p>
Equating the degree 3 terms gives us <m>4a_4 = a_3</m> or <m>a_4 = \frac{a_3}{4}</m>. Since <m>a_3 = \frac{a_0}{3!}</m>, we have <m>a_4 = \frac{a_0}{4!}</m>.
</p>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Observe that there is a pattern in (b)-(e). Find a general formula for <m>a_k</m> in terms of <m>a_0</m>.


<solution><statement>
<p>
Equating the degree <m>k-1</m> terms gives us <m>ka_k = a_{k-1}</m> or <m>a_k = \frac{a_{k-1}}{k}</m>. It appears that <m>a_{k-1} = \frac{a_0}{(k-1)!}</m>, so we have
</p>
  
<me>
a_k = \frac{a_0}{k!}.
</me>
 </statement>
</solution>
</li>
<li>Write the series expansion for <m>y</m> using only the unknown coefficient <m>a_0</m>. From this, determine what familiar functions satisfy the differential equation <xref ref="eq_PA8.6_Resistance_ode" />. (<b>Hint</b>: Compare to a familiar Taylor series.)


<solution><statement>
<p>
Since <m>a_k = \frac{a_0}{k!}</m> we have
</p>
  
<me>
y = a_0 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!}.
</me>
 
<p>
So the functions that satisfy the differential equation <xref ref="eq_PA8.6_Resistance_ode" /> are the exponential functions of the form <m>y = a_0e^x</m>.

<title>Power Series</title>
<p>
\knownindex{\lt main>power series\lt /main>}
</p>
  
<p>
As Preview <xref ref="PA_8.6">Activity</xref> shows, it can be useful to treat an unknown function as if it has a Taylor series, and then determine the coefficients from other information. In other words, we define a function as an infinite series of powers of <m>x</m> and then determine the coefficients based on something besides a formula for the function. This method of using series illustrated in Preview <xref ref="PA_8.6">Activity</xref> to solve differential equations is a powerful and important one that allows us to approximate solutions to many different types of differential equations even if we cannot explicitly solve them. This approach is different from defining a Taylor series based on a given function, and these functions we define with arbitrary coefficients are given a special name.
</p>
  
<definition><statement>
<p>
A power series centered at <m>x = a</m> is a function of the form
</p>
  
<men xml:id="eq_8.6_power_series" >
 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k
</men>
 
<p>
where <m>\{c_k\}</m> is a sequence of real numbers and <m>x</m> is an independent variable.
</p>
 </statement>
</definition>
 
<p>
We can substitute different values for <m>x</m> and test whether the resulting series converges or diverges. Thus, a power series defines a function <m>f</m> whose domain is the set of <m>x</m> values for which the power series converges. We therefore write
</p>
  
<me>
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k.
</me>
  
<p>
It turns out that<fn>See <xref ref="ex_8.5.2">Exercise</xref> in this section.</fn>, on its interval of convergence, a power series is the Taylor series of the function that is the sum of the power series, so all of the techniques we developed in the previous section can be applied to power series as well.
</p>
  <u>\hspace{5.0in}</u> 
<example xml:id="Ex_8.6.1"><statement>
<p>
Consider the power series defined by
</p>
  
<me>
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{2^k}.
</me>
 
<p>
What are <m>f(1)</m> and <m>f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>? Find a general formula for <m>f(x)</m> and determine the values for which this power series converges.
</p>
 </statement>
</example>
 
<p>
<b>Solution.</b><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp />
If we evaluate <m>f</m> at <m>x=1</m> we obtain the series
</p>
  
<me>
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k}
</me>
 
<p>
which is a geometric series with ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. So we can sum this series and find that
</p>
  
<me>
f(1) = \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 2.
</me>
 
<p>
Similarly,
</p>
  
<me>
f(3/2) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^k = \frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{4}} = 4.
</me>
 
<p>
In general, <m>f(x)</m> is a geometric series with ratio <m>\frac{x}{2}</m> and
</p>
  
<me>
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^k = \frac{1}{1-\frac{x}{2}} = \frac{2}{2-x}
</me>
 
<p>
provided that <m>-1 \lt  \frac{x}{2} \lt  1</m> (so that the ratio is less than 1 in absolute value). Thus, the power series that defines <m>f</m> converges for <m>-2 \lt  x \lt  2</m>.
</p>
  <u>\hspace{5.0in}</u>  
<p>
As with Taylor series, we define the interval of convergence of a power series <xref ref="eq_8.6_power_series" /> to be the set of values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges. In the same way as we did with Taylor series, we typically use the Ratio Test to find the values of <m>x</m> for which the power series converges absolutely, and then check the endpoints separately if the radius of convergence is finite.
</p>
  <u>\hspace{5.0in}</u> 
<example xml:id="Ex_8.6.2"><statement>
<p>
Let <m>f(x) = \ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k^2}</m>. Determine the interval of convergence of this power series.
</p>
 </statement>
</example>
 
<p>
<b>Solution.</b><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp />
First we will draw graphs of some of the partial sums of this power series to get an idea of the interval of convergence. Let
</p>
  
<me>
S_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{x^k}{k^2}
</me>
 
<p>
for each <m>n \geq 1</m>. <xref ref="F_8.6.Power_Series">Figure</xref> shows plots of <m>S_{10}(x)</m> (in red), <m>S_{25}(x)</m> (in blue), and <m>S_{50}(x)</m> (in green).
</p>
  <figure xml:id="F_8.6.Power_Series" >
<caption>Graphs of partial sums of the power series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k^2}</m></caption>
\resizebox{!}{2.25in}{<image source="images/8_6_Power_Series.png" /> } </figure>
 
<p>
The behavior of <m>S_{50}</m> particularly highlights that it appears to be converging to a particular curve on the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>, while growing without bound outside of that interval. This suggests that the interval of convergence might be <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  1</m>. To more fully understand this power series, we apply the Ratio Test to determine the values of <m>x</m> for which the power series converges absolutely. For the given series, we have
</p>
  
<me>
a_k = \frac{x^k}{k^2},
</me>
 
<p>
so
</p>
  
<md><mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\left| a_{k+1} \right|}{ \left| a_k \right|} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{|x|^{k+1}}{(k+1)^2} }{ \frac{| x|^{k}}{k^2} }</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} |x| \left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^2</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = |x| \lim_{k \to \infty}  \left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^2</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = |x|.</mrow>
 
</md>
 
<p>
Therefore, the Ratio Test tells us that the given power series <m>f(x)</m> converges absolutely when <m>| x | \lt  1</m> and diverges when <m>| x | > 1</m>. Since the Ratio Test is inconclusive when <m>|x| = 1</m>, we need to check <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = -1</m> individually.
</p>
  
<p>
When <m>x = 1</m>, observe that
</p>
  
<me>
f(1) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}.
</me>
 
<p>
This is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p > 1</m>, which we know converges. When <m>x = -1</m>, we have
</p>
  
<me>
f(-1) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2}.
</me>
 
<p>
This is an alternating series, and since the sequence <m>\left\{ \frac{1}{n^2} \right\}</m> decreases to 0, the power series converges when <m>x=-1</m> by the Alternating Series Test. Thus, the interval of convergence of this power series is <m>-1 \le x \le 1</m>.
</p>
  <u>\hspace{5.0in}</u>

<md><mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{|x-1|^{k+1}}{3(k+1)} }{ \frac{|x-1|^k}{3k} } \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{3k|x-1|^{k+1}}{3(k+1)|x-1|^{k}}</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = |x-1| \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k}{k+1}</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = |x-1|.</mrow>
 
</md>
 
    So the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(x-1)^k}{3k}</m> converges absolutely when <m>|x-1| \lt  1</m> or when <m>0 \lt  x \lt  2</m> and diverges outside this interval. To completely determine the interval of convergence, we need to check what happens at the endpoints of this interval.
    <ul><li>When <m>x=0</m> our power series is <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{3k}</m> which is just a scalar multiple of the alternating harmonic series and so converges.</li>
<li>When <m>x=2</m> our power series is <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3k}</m> which is just a scalar multiple of the harmonic series and so diverges.</li>
 </ul>  
    Therefore, the interval of convergence of the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(x-1)^k}{3k}</m> is <m>[0,2)</m>.</li>
<li>We use the Ratio Test with <m>a_k = k|x|^k</m>:

 <mrow>\amp = |x|.</mrow>
 
</md>
 
    So the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} kx^k</m> converges absolutely when <m>|x| \lt  1</m> or when <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  1</m> and diverges outside this interval. To completely determine the interval of convergence, we need to check what happens at the endpoints of this interval.
    <ul><li>When <m>x=-1</m> our power series is <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^k k</m>. Since <m>k \to \infty</m> as <m>k \to infty</m>, this series diverges by the Divergence Test.</li>
<li>When <m>x=1</m> our power series is <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k</m> which again diverges by the Divergence Test.</li>
 </ul>  
    Therefore, the interval of convergence of the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} kx^k</m> is <m>(-1,1)</m>.</li>
<li>We use the Ratio Test with <m>a_k = \frac{k^2|x+1|^k}{4^k}</m>:
    
<md><mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{(k+1)^2|x+1|^{k+1}}{4^{k+1}} }{ \frac{k^2|x+1|^k}{4^k} } \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{4^k(k+1)^2|x+1|^{k+1}}{4^{k+1}k^2|x+1|^k}</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{4}|x+1| \lim_{k \to \infty} \left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{4}|x+1|.</mrow>
 
</md>
 
    So the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k^2(x+1)^k}{4^k}</m> converges absolutely when <m>\frac{1}{4}|x+1| \lt  1</m> or when <m>-5 \lt  x \lt  3</m> and diverges outside this interval. To completely determine the interval of convergence, we need to check what happens at the endpoints of this interval.
    <ul><li>When <m>x=-5</m> our power series is <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^k k^2</m>. Since <m>k^2 \to \infty</m> as <m>k \to \infty</m>, this series diverges by the Divergence Test.</li>

It turns out that our work in <xref ref="x8.6.Act2">Activity</xref> holds more generally. The corresponding theorem, which we will not prove, states that we can differentiate a power series for a function <m>f</m> term by term and obtain the series expansion for <m>f'</m>, and similarly we can integrate a series expansion for a function <m>f</m> term by term and obtain the series expansion for <m>\ds \int f(x) \ dx</m>. For both, the radius of convergence of the resulting series is the same as the original, though it is possible that the convergence status of the resulting series may differ at the endpoints. The formal statement of the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem follows.
</p>

{
<b>Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem.</b> Suppose <m>f(x)</m> has a power series expansion
</p>
  
<me>
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_kx^k
</me>
 
<p>
so that the series converges absolutely to <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>-r \lt  x \lt  r</m>. Then, the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} kc_kx^{k-1}</m> obtained by differentiating the power series for <m>f(x)</m> term by term converges absolutely to <m>f'(x)</m> on the interval <m>-r \lt  x \lt  r</m>. That is,
</p>
  
<me>
f'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} kc_kx^{k-1}, \ \mbox{for}  \ |x| \lt  r. 
</me>
 
<p>
Similarly, the power series <m>\ds \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k\frac{x^{k+1}}{k+1}</m> obtained by integrating the power series for <m>f(x)</m> term by term converges absolutely on the interval <m>-r \lt  x \lt  r</m>, and

This theorem validates the steps we took in <xref ref="x8.6.Act3">Activity</xref>. It is important to note that this result about differentiating and integrating power series tells us that we can differentiate and integrate term by term on the interior of the interval of convergence, but it does not tell us what happens at the endpoints of this interval. We always need to check what happens at the endpoints separately. More importantly, we can use use the approach of differentiating or integrating a series term by term to find new series.

Find a series expansion centered at <m>x = 0</m> for <m>\arctan(x)</m>, as well as its interval of convergence.

 </statement>
</example>

<b>Solution.</b><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp />
While we could differentiate <m>\arctan(x)</m> repeatedly and look for patterns in the derivative values at <m>x = 0</m> in an attempt to find the Maclaurin series for <m>\arctan(x)</m> from the definition, it turns out to be far easier to use a known series in an insightful way. In <xref ref="x8.6.Act2">Activity</xref>, we found that
</p>
  
<me>
\frac{1}{1+x^2} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k x^{2k}
</me>
 
<p>
for <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  1</m>. Recall that
</p>
  
<me>
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \arctan(x) \right] = \frac{1}{1+x^2},
</me>
 
<p>
and therefore
</p>
  
<me>
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \ dx = \arctan(x) + C.
</me>
 
<p>
It follows that we can integrate the series for <m>\ds \frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> term by term to obtain the power series expansion for <m>\arctan(x)</m>. Doing so, we find that
</p>
  
<md><mrow>\arctan(x) \amp = \int \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^kx^{2k} \right) \ dx</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \int (-1)^k x^{2k} \ dx \right)</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1} \right) + C.</mrow>
 
</md>
 
<p>
The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that this equality is valid for at least <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  1</m>.
</p>
  
<p>
To find the value of the constant <m>C</m>, we can use the fact that <m>\arctan(0) = 0</m>. So
</p>
  
<me>
0 = \arctan(0) = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{0^{2k+1}}{2k+1} \right) + C = C,
</me>
 
<p>
and we must have <m>C = 0</m>. Therefore,
</p>
  
<men xml:id="E_arctanseries" >
 \arctan(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}
</men>
 
<p>
for at least <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  1</m>.
</p>
  
<p>
It is a straightforward exercise to check that the power series
</p>
  
<me>
 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}
</me>
 
<p>
converges both when <m>x = -1</m> and when <m>x = 1</m>; in each case, we have an alternating series with terms <m>\frac{1}{2k+1}</m> that decrease to 0, and thus the interval of convergence for the series expansion for <m>\arctan(x)</m> in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E_arctanseries" /> is <m>-1 \le x \le 1.</m>

It may not be obvious, but there is a pattern.
</p>
  <ul><li>All of the terms involving <m>a_2</m> are 0. These terms are <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_5</m>, <m>a_8</m>, etc. The subscripts of these terms are all of the form <m>3k+2</m>. So <m>a_{3k+2} = 0</m> for every positive integer <m>k</m>.</li>
<li>The terms that involve <m>a_0</m> have the form <m>a_3</m>, <m>a_6</m>, <m>a_{9}</m>, etc. and are all of the form <m>a_{3k}</m> for positive integers <m>k</m>. The pattern in the denominators of the coefficient for <m>a_{3k}</m> is <m>(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)</m>. So
    
<me>
a_{3k} = \frac{1}{(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)} a_0 \text{ for }  k \geq 1.
</me>
</li>
<li>The terms that involve <m>a_1</m> have the form <m>a_4</m>, <m>a_7</m>, <m>a_{10}</m>, etc. and are all of the form <m>a_{3k+1}</m> for positive integers <m>k</m>. The pattern in the denominators of the coefficient for <m>a_{3k+1}</m> is <m>(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)</m>. So
    
<me>
a_{3k+1} = \frac{1}{(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)} a_1 \text{ for }  k \geq 1.

<li>Use the previous part to conclude that the general solution to the Airy equation <xref ref="eq_PA8.6_Airy_equation" /> is

<md><mrow>y \amp  = \amp  a_0\left( 1+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{3k}}{(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)} \right)</mrow>
 <mrow>\amp  \ \amp  \  + a_1 \left( x + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{3k+1}}{(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)} \right).</mrow>

Any values for <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m> then determine a specific solution that we can approximate as closely as we like using this series solution.


<solution><statement>
<p>
We can write our solution <m>y</m> in three pieces as
</p>
  
<me>
y = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} a_kx^k = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{3k}x^{3k} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{3k+1}x^{3k+1} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{3k+2}x^{3k+2}
</me>
 
<p>
and so our results from the previous part of this exercise show that
</p>
  
<me>
y = a_0\left( 1+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{3k}}{(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)} \right) + a_1 \left( x + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{3k+1}}{(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)} \right).

\item A more complicated differential equation is one that governs the motion of a pendulum. Mechanics tells us that the motion of a pendulum of length <m>L</m> with mass <m>m</m> is governed by the differential equation
</p>
  
<me>
mL \frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} = -mg \sin(\theta)
</me>
 
<p>
where <m>t</m> is time and <m>\theta</m> is the angle the pendulum makes with its vertical axis.
</p>
  
<p>
We do not have the machinery to solve this differential equation exactly, but we can approximate a solution as closely as we like by assuming that a solution <m>\theta</m> has a Taylor series expansion about the origin. In other words, assume that
</p>
  
<me>
\theta = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nt_n,
</me>
 
<p>
where the coefficients are undetermined. Then

 <mrow>\frac{d \theta}{dt} \amp = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} na_nt_{n-1}</mrow>
 <mrow>\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} \amp = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} (n-1)na_nt_{n-2}</mrow>

 <mrow>\frac{d^3 \theta}{dt^3} \amp = -\frac{g}{L}\left[\cos(\theta)\frac{d \theta}{dt}\right]</mrow>
 <mrow>\frac{d^4 \theta}{dt^4} \amp = -\frac{g}{L}\left[-\sin(\theta)\left(\frac{d \theta}{dt}\right)^2 + \cos(theta)\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} \right]</mrow>

<p>
If we seek a solution with initial conditions <m>\theta(0) = \frac{\pi}{6}</m> and <m>\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0) = 0</m>, then we have
</p>
  
<md><mrow>\theta(0) \amp = a_0 = \frac{\pi}{6}</mrow>
 <mrow>\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0) \amp = a_1 = 0</mrow>
 <mrow>\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}(0) \amp = 2a_2 = -\frac{g}{L} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{g}{2L}</mrow>
 <mrow>\frac{d^3 \theta}{dt^3}(0) \amp = 6a_3 = -\frac{g}{L}\cos(\theta(0))\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0) = 0</mrow>
 <mrow>\frac{d^4 \theta}{dt^4}(0) \amp = 24a_4 = -\frac{g}{L}\left[-\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\left(\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0)\right)^2 + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}(0) \right] = -\frac{g}{L}\left[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(-\frac{g}{2L}\right)\right]</mrow>
 <mrow>\vdots \amp = \vdots</mrow>
 
</md>
 
<p>
This gives us
</p>
  
<me>
a_0 = \frac{\pi}{6}, \ \ a_1 = 0, \ \ a_2 = -\frac{g}{4L}, \ \ a_3 = 0, \ \ a_4 = \frac{\sqrt{3} g^2}{96L^2}
</me>
 
<p>
and an approximation of <m>\theta</m> as
</p>
  
<me>
\theta \approx \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{g}{4L}t^2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}g^2}{96L^2} t^4.
</me>
 
<p>
We could keep going to determine more and more terms in this Taylor series for <m>\theta</m>, but the point is that we can use series like this one to approximate functions. The difference between this type of problem and our use of Taylor series is that to determine the terms in a Taylor series, we need to know the function from which we derive the series. In this differential equation example, we didn't know the function <m>\theta</m>, be we could calculate terms in a series expansion for <m>\theta</m> because we had enough information about <m>\theta</m>.
