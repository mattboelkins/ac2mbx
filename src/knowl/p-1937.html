In the exponential model we introduced in <a knowl="./knowl/A_7.6.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_7.6.1" alt="Exercise 7.6.1 " title="Exercise 7.6.1 ">ActivityÂ 7.6.1</a>, the per capita growth rate is
constant. In particular, we are assuming that when the population is
large, the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population
is small. It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should
decrease when the population becomes large, since there will not be
enough resources to support so many people. In other words, we expect that a more realistic model would hold if we assume
that the per capita growth rate depends on the population \(P\).
