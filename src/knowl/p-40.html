Now, two things are essential to note: this average velocity depends on \(x\) (indeed, \(AV_{[1,x]}\) is a function of \(x\)), and our most focused interest in this function occurs near \(x = 1\), which is where the function is not defined. Said differently, the function \(g(x) = \frac{16 - 16x^2}{x-1}\) tells us the average velocity of the ball on the interval from \(t = 1\) to \(t = x\), and if we are interested in the instantaneous velocity of the ball when \(t = 1\), we'd like to know what happens to \(g(x)\) as \(x\) gets closer and closer to \(1\). At the same time, \(g(1)\) is not defined, because it leads to the quotient \(0/0\).
