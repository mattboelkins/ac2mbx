</h5>
<p id="p-512">
Use known derivative rules, including the chain rule, as needed to answer each of the following questions.
</p>
<ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-951">Find an equation for the tangent line to the curve \(y= \sqrt{e^x + 3}\) at the point where \(x=0\).</li>
<li id="li-952">If \(\displaystyle s(t) = \frac{1}{(t^2+1)^3}\) represents the position function of a particle moving horizontally along an axis at time \(t\) (where \(s\) is measured in inches and \(t\) in seconds), find the particle's instantaneous velocity at \(t=1\).  Is the particle moving to the left or right at that instant?</li>
<li id="li-953">At sea level, air pressure is 30 inches of mercury.  At an altitude of \(h\) feet above sea level, the air pressure, \(P\), in inches of mercury, is given by the function

<span class="displaymath" id="me-178">\[
P = 30 e^{-0.0000323 h}.
\]</span>
 
Compute \(dP/dh\) and explain what this derivative function tells you about air pressure, including a discussion of the units on \(dP/dh\).  In addition, determine how fast the air pressure is changing for a pilot of a small plane passing through an altitude of \(1000\) feet.</li>
<li id="li-954">Suppose that \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are differentiable functions and that the following information about them is known:
	
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-17"> 
   \(x\) 	\amp  \(f(x)\)  	\amp  \(f'(x)\)	\amp  \(g(x)\)	\amp  \(g'(x)\) 

   \(-1\) 	\amp  \(2\)	\amp  \(-5\) \amp  \(-3\) \amp   \(4\) 

   \(2\) 	\amp  \(-3\)	\amp  \(4\) \amp  \(-1\) \amp   \(2\) </figure> 

If \(C(x)\) is a function given by the formula \(f(g(x))\), determine \(C'(2)\).   In addition, if \(D(x)\) is the function \(f(f(x))\), find \(D'(-1)\).</li>
