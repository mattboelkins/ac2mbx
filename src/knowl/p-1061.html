Much of our work in <a href="C_4.html" alt="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral" title="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral">Chapter 4</a> has been motivated by the velocity-distance problem: if we know the instantaneous velocity function, \(v(t)\), for a moving object on a given time interval \([a,b]\), can we determine its exact distance traveled on \([a,b]\)? In the vast majority of our discussion in <a href="S_4.1.VelocityDistance.html" alt="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity" title="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity">Sections 4.1</a>- <a href="S_4.3.DefiniteIntegral.html" alt="Section 4.3 The Definite Integral" title="Section 4.3 The Definite Integral">4.3</a>, we have focused on the fact that this distance traveled is connected to the area bounded by \(y = v(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis on \([a,b]\). In particular, for any nonnegative velocity function \(y = v(t)\) on \([a,b]\), we know that the exact area bounded by the velocity curve and the \(t\)-axis on the interval tells us the total distance traveled, which is also the value of the definite integral \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\). In the situation where velocity is sometimes negative, the total area bounded by the velocity function still tells us distance traveled, while the net signed area that the function bounds tells us the object's change in position.
