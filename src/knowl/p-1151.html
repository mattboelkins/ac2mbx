Further, we now see that if a function has a single antiderivative, it must have infinitely many: we can add any constant of our choice to the antiderivative and get another antiderivative. For this reason, we sometimes refer to the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">general antiderivative</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;antiderivative\lt /main&gt;\lt sub&gt;general\lt /sub&gt;} of a function \(f\). For example, if \(f(x) = x^2\), its general antiderivative is \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\), where we include the “\(+C\)” to indicate that \(F\) includes <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">all</em> of the possible antiderivatives of \(f\). To identify a particular antiderivative of \(f\), we must be provided a single value of the antiderivative \(F\) (this value is often called an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">initial condition</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;initial condition\lt /main&gt;}). In the present example, suppose that condition is \(F(2) = 3\); substituting the value of 2 for \(x\) in \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\), we find that
