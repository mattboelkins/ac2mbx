<li id="li-1548">Note that the lengths of the legs of the overall right triangle will be \(15\) for the vertical one and \(x + s\) for the horizontal one, with a smaller right triangle with legs of length 6 and \(s\).</li>
<li id="li-1549">The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, with legs \(6\) and \(s\) is similar to the large triangle that has legs of length \(15\) and \(x + s\).  Remember that the ratios of the lengths of legs of similar triangles must be equal.</li>
<li id="li-1550">Simplify the equation in (b) as much as possible before differentiating implicitly with respect to \(t\).</li>
<li id="li-1551">Find \(\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8}\).  Your answer should not depend on the value of \(x\).</li>
<li id="li-1552">Does the equation that relates \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{ds}{dt}\) involve \(x\)?  Is \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) changing or constant?</li>
<li id="li-1553">Let \(y\) represent the location of the tip of the shadow, so that \(y = x + s\).  Observe that you can then write \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) in terms of \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{ds}{dt}\).</li>
