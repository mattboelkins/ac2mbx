<li id="li-482">We know that \(g(x) = |x|\) is given by the formula \(g(x) = -x\) when \(x \lt  0\) and by \(g(x) = x\) when \(x \ge 0\).  Each of these pieces of \(g\) is a straight line, so at every point other than the point where they meet, the function \(g\) has a well-defined slope, and thus is differentiable.</li>
<li id="li-483">Observe that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="md-12">\begin{align*}
g'(0) \amp  = \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(0+h)-g(0)}{h}\\
\amp  = \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|0+h|-|0|}{h}\\
\amp  = \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}
\end{align*}</span>
</li>
<li id="li-484">Following up on our work in (b), note that whenever \(h &gt; 0\), \(|h| = h\), and thus
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-61">\[
\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h}{h} = 1,
\]</span>
 
	while whenever \(h \lt  0\), \(|h| = -h\), and thus
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-62">\[
\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = -1
\]</span>
 
	Since the right- and left-hand limits are not equal, it follows that 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-63">\[
g'(0) =  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}
\]</span>
 
	does not exist.</li>
<li id="li-485">\(f\) is not differentiable at \(a = -2, -1, 2, 3\) because at each of these points \(f\) is not continuous.  In addition, \(f\) is not differentiable at \(a = -3\) and \(a = 1\) because the graph of \(f\) has a corner point (or cusp) at each of these values.</li>
<li id="li-486">True: if a function \(p\) is differentiable at \(x = b\), then \(\lim_{x \to b} p(x)\) must exist.  This is true because we know that if \(p\) is differentiable at a point, then \(p\) is continuous there, and anytime a function is continuous at a point, it must have a limit there.</li>
