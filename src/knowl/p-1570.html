For example, in the setting where we have a nonnegative velocity function that is not constant, over a short time interval \(\triangle t\) we know that the distance traveled is approximately \(v(t) \triangle t\), since \(v(t)\) is almost constant on a small interval, and for a constant rate, distance = rate \(\cdot\) time. Similarly, if we are thinking about the area under a nonnegative function \(f\) whose value is changing, on a short interval \(\triangle x\) the area under the curve is approximately the area of the rectangle whose height is \(f(x)\) and whose width is \(\triangle x\): \(f(x) \triangle x\). Both of these principles are represented visually in <a knowl="./knowl/F_6.3.VelArea.html" knowl-id="xref-F_6.3.VelArea" alt="Figure 6.3.1 " title="Figure 6.3.1 ">FigureÂ 6.3.1</a>.
