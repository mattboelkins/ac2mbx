\item An object moving along a straight line path has a differentiable position function \(y = s(t)\). It is known that at time \(t = 9\) seconds, the object's position is \(s = 4\) feet (measured from its starting point at \(t = 0\)). Furthermore, the object's instantaneous velocity at \(t = 9\) is \(-1.2\) feet per second, and its acceleration at the same instant is \(0.08\) feet per second per second.
