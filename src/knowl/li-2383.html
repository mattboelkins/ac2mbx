</h5>Picture the coordinate axes rotated 90 degrees clockwise so that the positive \(x\)-axis points straight down, and the positive \(y\)-axis points to the right.  Suppose that \(R\) is rotated about the \(x\) axis to form a solid of revolution, and we consider this solid as a storage tank.  Suppose that the resulting tank is filled to a depth of 1.5 feet with water weighing 62.4 pounds per cubic foot.  Find the amount of work required to lower the water in the tank until it is 0.5 feet deep, by pumping the water to the top of the tank.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_6.4.Physics.html#li-2383">in-context</a></span>
