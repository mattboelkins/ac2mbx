it follows that not only does \(h \to 0\) in the denominator, but also \((f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0\) in the numerator, since \(f\) is continuous. Thus, the fundamental form of the limit involved in the definition of \(f'(x)\) is \(\frac{0}{0}\). Remember, saying a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do: indeed, limits of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) can take on any value, as is evidenced by evaluating \(f'(x)\) for varying values of \(x\) for a function such as \(f'(x) = x^2\).
