For such a horizontal rectangle, note that its width depends on \(y\), the height at which the rectangle is constructed. In particular, at a height \(y\) between \(y = -1\) and \(y = 2\), the right end of a representative rectangle is determined by the line, \(x = y+1\), while the left end of the rectangle is determined by the parabola, \(x = y^2-1\), and the thickness of the rectangle is \(\triangle y\).
