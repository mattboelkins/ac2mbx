Consider a simple example where a person goes for a walk on a beach along a stretch of very straight shoreline that runs east-west. We can naturally assume that their initial position is \(s(0) = 0\), and further stipulate that their position function increases as they move east from their starting location. For instance, a position of \(s = 1\) mile represents being one mile east of the start location, while \(s = -1\) tells us the person is one mile west of where they began walking on the beach. Now suppose the person walks in the following manner. From the outset at \(t = 0\), the person walks due east at a constant rate of \(3\) mph for 1.5 hours. After 1.5 hours, the person stops abruptly and begins walking due west at the constant rate of \(4\) mph and does so for 0.5 hours. Then, after another abrupt stop and start, the person resumes walking at a constant rate of \(3\) mph to the east for one more hour. What is the total distance the person traveled on the time interval \(t = 0\) to \(t = 3\)? What is the person's total change in position over that time?
