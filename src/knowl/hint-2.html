<li id="li-15">On \([0.4,0.8]\), the average velocity is \(AV_{[0.4,0.8]} = \frac{s(0.8)-s(0.4)}{0.8-0.4}\) ft/sec.  Each of the other average velocities is computed similarly.</li>
<li id="li-16">Remember that the slope of a line can be found by taking “rise over run.”  In this context, the slope is found by computing “change in \(s\) over change in \(t\).”  Note that each average velocity \(\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}\) can be viewed as the slope of a line between \((a,s(a))\) and \((b,s(b))\).</li>
<li id="li-17">While the curve \(s(t)\) is a parabola, how does it look up close on a very small interval?  What type of familiar function seems to emerge?</li>
<li id="li-18">“Instantaneous” velocity can be approximated by average velocity on a very small interval.  Are the numbers you computed in (a) getting close to a particular value as we look at smaller and smaller intervals surrounding \(t = 0.8\)?</li>
