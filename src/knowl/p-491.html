It makes sense intuitively that these two quantities are involved in understanding the rate of change of a composite function: if we are considering \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) and asking how fast \(C\) is changing at a given \(x\) value as \(x\) changes, it clearly matters (a) how fast \(g\) is changing at \(x\), as well as how fast \(f\) is changing at the value of \(g(x)\). It turns out that this structure holds not only for the functions in <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_2.5.Linear.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_2.5.Linear" alt="Example 2.5.1 " title="Example 2.5.1 ">Examples 2.5.1</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_2.5.DoubleAngle.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_2.5.DoubleAngle" alt="Example 2.5.2 " title="Example 2.5.2 ">2.5.2</a>, but indeed for all differentiable functions<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-16" id="fn-16"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-16" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Like other differentiation rules, the Chain Rule can be proved formally using the limit definition of the derivative.</span></span> as is stated in the Chain Rule.
