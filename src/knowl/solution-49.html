<li id="li-1288">We first note that \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\), so to find critical values we set \(p'(x) = 0\) and solve for \(x\).  This leads to the equation \(3x^2 - a = 0\), which implies 
  
<span class="displaymath" id="me-322">\[
x^2 = \frac{a}{3}.
\]</span>
 
  If \(a &gt; 0\), then the solutions to this equation are \(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\); if \(a \lt  0\), then the equation has no solution.  Hence, \(p\) has two critical numbers (\(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\)) whenever \(a &gt; 0\) and no critical numbers when \(a \lt  0\).</li>
<li id="li-1289">For the case when \(a \lt  0\), we observe that \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\) is positive for every value of \(x\), and thus \(p\) is always increasing and has no relative extreme values.  (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart, and \(p'\) is always positive.)
  
  For the case when \(a &gt; 0\), we observe that \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\) is a concave up parabola with zeros at \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\) and \(x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\).  It follows that for \(x \lt  -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), \(p'(x) &gt; 0\) (so \(p\) is increasing); for \(-\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}} \lt  x \lt  \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), \(p'(x) &gt; 0\) (so \(p\) is decreasing); and for \(x &gt; \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), \(p'(x) &gt; 0\) (so \(p\) is again increasing).  In this situation, we see that \(p\) has a relative maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\) and a relative minimum at \(x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\).</li>
<li id="li-1290">Since \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\) and \(a\) is constant, it follows that \(p''(x) = 6x\).  Note that \(p''(x) = 0\) when \(x = 0\) and that \(p''(x) \lt  0\) for \(x \lt  0\) and \(p''(x) &gt; 0\) for \(x &gt; 0\).  Hence \(p\) is CCD for \(x \lt  0\) and \(p\) is CCU for \(x &gt; 0\), making \(x = 0\) an inflection point.</li>
<li id="li-1291">Below, we show the two possible situations. At left, for the case when \(a \lt  0\) and \(p\) is always increasing with an inflection point at \(x = 0\), and at right for when \(a &gt; 0\) and \(p\) has a relative maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\) and a relative minimum at \(x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), again with an inflection point at \(x = 0\).  Note, too, that \(p\) has its \(x\)-intercepts at \(x = \pm \sqrt{a}\).
