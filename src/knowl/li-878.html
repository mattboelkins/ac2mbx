</h5>When a mass hangs from a spring and is set in motion, the object's position oscillates in a way that the size of the oscillations decrease.  This is usually called a <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">damped oscillation</em>.  Suppose that for a particular object, its displacement from equilibrium (where the object sits at rest) is modeled by the function

s(t) = \frac{15 \sin(t)}{e^t}.
\]</span>
 
Assume that \(s\) is measured in inches and \(t\) in seconds.  Sketch a graph of this function for \(t \ge 0\) to see how it represents the situation described.  Then compute \(ds/dt\), state the units on this function, and explain what it tells you about the object's motion.  Finally, compute and interpret \(s'(2)\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2.4.OtherTrig.html#li-878">in-context</a></span>
