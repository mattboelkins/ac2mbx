In <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.6.LogExp.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.6.LogExp" alt="Figure 2.6.3 " title="Figure 2.6.3 ">FigureÂ 2.6.3</a>, we are reminded that since the natural exponential function has the property that its derivative is itself, the slope of the tangent to \(y = e^x\) is equal to the height of the curve at that point. For instance, at the point \(A = (\ln(0.5), 0.5)\), the slope of the tangent line is \(m_A = 0.5\), and at \(B = (\ln(5), 5)\), the tangent line's slope is \(m_B = 5\). At the corresponding points \(A'\) and \(B'\) on the graph of the natural logarithm function (which come from reflecting across the line \(y = x\)), we know that the slope of the tangent line is the reciprocal of the \(x\)-coordinate of the point (since \(\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}\)). Thus, with \(A' = (0.5, \ln(0.5))\), we have \(m_{A'} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2\), and at \(B' = (5, \ln(5))\), \(m_{B'} = \frac{1}{5}\).
