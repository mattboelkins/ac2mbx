As seen in <a knowl="./knowl/F_5.6.MidVTrap.html" knowl-id="xref-F_5.6.MidVTrap" alt="Figure 5.6.4 " title="Figure 5.6.4 ">Figure 5.6.4</a>, it is evident that whenever the function is concave up on an interval, the Trapezoid Rule with one subinterval, \(T_1\), will overestimate the exact value of the definite integral on that interval. Moreover, from a careful analysis of the line that bounds the top of the rectangle for the Midpoint Rule (shown in magenta), we see that if we rotate this line segment until it is tangent to the curve at the point on the curve used in the Midpoint Rule (as shown at right in <a knowl="./knowl/F_5.6.MidVTrap.html" knowl-id="xref-F_5.6.MidVTrap" alt="Figure 5.6.4 " title="Figure 5.6.4 ">Figure 5.6.4</a>), the resulting trapezoid has the same area as \(M_1\), and this value is less than the exact value of the definite integral. Hence, when the function is concave up on the interval, \(M_1\) underestimates the integral's true value.
