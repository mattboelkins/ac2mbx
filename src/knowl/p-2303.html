Conditionally convergent series turn out to be very interesting. If the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) decreases to 0, but the series \(\sum a_k\) diverges, the conditionally convergent series \(\sum (-1)^k a_k\) is right on the borderline of being a divergent series. As a result, any conditionally convergent series converges very slowly. Furthermore, some very strange things can happen with conditionally convergent series, as illustrated in some of the exercises.
