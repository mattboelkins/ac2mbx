\item We can use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis by taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution which will then be circular disks or washers.
\item If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our slices are horizontal and of thickness \(\triangle y\). This leads us to integrate with respect to \(y\), as opposed to with respect to \(x\) when we slice a solid vertically.
\item If we revolve about a line other than the \(x\)- or \(y\)-axis, we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice. Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.
