</h5>A moving particle is traveling along the curve given by \(y = f(x) = 0.1x^2 + 1\), and does so at a constant rate of 7 cm/sec, where both \(x\) and \(y\) are measured in cm (that is, the curve \(y = f(x)\) is the path along which the object actually travels; the curve is not a “position function”).  Find the position of the particle when \(t = 4\) sec, assuming that when \(t = 0\), the particle's location is \((0,f(0))\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_6.1.Area.html#li-2240">in-context</a></span>
