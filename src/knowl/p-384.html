While the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, it turns out that the rules for computing derivatives of products and quotients are more complicated. In what follows we explore why this is the case, what the product and quotient rules actually say, and work to expand our repertoire of functions we can easily differentiate. To start, Preview <a href="S_2.3.ProdQuot.html#PA_2.3" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> asks you to investigate the derivative of a product and quotient of two polynomials.
