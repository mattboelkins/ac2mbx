There are at least two additional important observations to make from <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_5.4.IBP.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_5.4.IBP" alt="Example 5.4.1 " title="Example 5.4.1 ">Example 5.4.1</a>. First, the general technique of Integration by Parts involves trading the problem of integrating the product of two functions for the problem of integrating the product of two related functions. In particular, we convert the problem of evaluating \(\int u \, dv\) for that of evaluating \(\int v \, du\). This perspective clearly shapes our choice of \(u\) and \(v\). In <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_5.4.IBP.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_5.4.IBP" alt="Example 5.4.1 " title="Example 5.4.1 ">Example 5.4.1</a>, the original integral to evaluate was \(\int x \cos(x) \,dx\), and through the substitution provided by Integration by Parts, we were instead able to evaluate \(\int \sin(x) \cdot 1 \, dx\). Note that the original function \(x\) was replaced by its derivative, while \(\cos(x)\) was replaced by its antiderivative. Second, observe that when we get to the final stage of evaluating the last remaining antiderivative, it is at this step that we include the integration constant, \(+C\).
