At this point, it is important to observe that since we are taking the limit as \(x \to -2\), we are considering \(x\) values that are close, but not equal, to \(-2\). Since we never actually allow \(x\) to equal \(-2\), the quotient \(\frac{2+x}{x+2}\) has value 1 for every possible value of \(x\). Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above, and now find that
