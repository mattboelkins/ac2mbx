\item For each of the following indefinite integrals, determine whether you would use \(u\)-substitution, integration by parts, neither, or both to evaluate the integral. In each case, write one sentence to explain your reasoning, and include a statement of any substitutions used. (That is, if you decide in a problem to let \(u = e^{3x}\), you should state that, as well as that \(du = 3e^{3x} \, dx\).) Finally, use your chosen approach to evaluate each integral.
