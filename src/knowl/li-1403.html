</h5>Here, we first observe that we are working on the domain of all real numbers, not a closed bounded interval.  Hence, we need to think about the overall behavior of the function.  First, since \(f(x) = 4 - e^{-(x-2)^2}\), by the chain rule we see that \(f'(x) = -e^{-(x-2)^2}(-2(x-2)) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}.\)  Since \(e^{-(x-2)^2}\) is always positive (in particular, never zero), it follows that the only critical value of \(f\) is \(x = 2\).  Furthermore, with \(f'(x) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\), we see that for \(x \lt  2\), \(f'(x) \lt  0\), while for \(x &gt; 2\), \(f'(x) &gt; 0\).  This tells us by the first derivative test that \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \lt  2\) and increasing for \(x &gt; 2\), which tells us that \(f\) has an absolute minimum at \(x = 2\), and \(f\) does not have an absolute maximum.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.3.Optimization.html#li-1403">in-context</a></span>
