The first derivative sign chart in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.signchart.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.signchart" alt="Figure 3.1.5 " title="Figure 3.1.5 ">Figure 3.1.5</a> comes from thinking about the sign of each of the terms in the factored form of \(f'(x)\) at one selected point in the interval under consideration. For instance, for \(x \lt  -1\), we could consider \(x = -2\) and determine the sign of \(e^{-2x}\), \((3-x)\), and \((x+1)^2\) at the value \(x = -2\). We note that both \(e^{-2x}\) and \((x+1)^2\) are positive regardless of the value of \(x\), while \((3-x)\) is also positive at \(x = -2\). Hence, each of the three terms in \(f'\) is positive, which we indicate by writing “\(+++\).” Taking the product of three positive terms obviously results in a value that is positive, which we denote by the “\(+\)” in the interval to the left of \(x = -1\) indicating the overall sign of \(f'\). And, since \(f'\) is positive on that interval, we further know that \(f\) is increasing, which we summarize by writing “INC” to represent the corresponding behavior of \(f\). In a similar way, we find that \(f'\) is positive and \(f\) is increasing on \(-1 \lt  x \lt  3\), and \(f'\) is negative and \(f\) is decreasing for \(x &gt; 3\).
