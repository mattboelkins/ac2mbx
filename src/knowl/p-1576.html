At this point, we note that we will be focused primarily on situations where mass is distributed relative to horizontal location, \(x\), for objects whose cross-sectional area is constant. In that setting, it makes sense to think of the density function \(\rho(x)\) with units “mass per unit length,” such as g/cm. Thus, when we compute \(\rho(x) \cdot \triangle x\) on a small slice \(\triangle x\), the resulting units are g/cm \(\cdot\) cm = g, which thus measures the mass of the slice. The general principle follows.
