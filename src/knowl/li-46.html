</h5>Let the function \(v(t)\) represent the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">instantaneous vertical velocity</em> of the diver at time \(t\) (i.e. the speed at which the height function \(s(t)\) is changing; note that velocity in the upward direction is positive, while the velocity of a falling object is negative).  Based on your understanding of the diver's behavior, as well as your graph of the position function, sketch a carefully labeled graph of \(v(t)\) on the axes provided  in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.1.Ez2.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.1.Ez2" alt="Figure 1.1.8 " title="Figure 1.1.8 ">Figure 1.1.8</a>.  Include scale and units on the vertical axis.  Write several sentences that explain how you constructed your graph, discussing when you expect \(v(t)\) to be zero, positive, negative, relatively large, and relatively small.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.1.Velocity.html#li-46">in-context</a></span>
