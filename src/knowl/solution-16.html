<li id="li-394">\(F'(t)\) has units measured in degrees Fahrenheit per minute.</li>
<li id="li-395">Using a central difference, 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-47">\[
F''(30) \approx \frac{F'(45)-F'(15)}{30} = \frac{2.45-6.03}{30} \approx -0.119.
\]</span>
</li>
<li id="li-396">The value \(F''(30) \approx -0.119\), which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment \(t = 30\), the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>falling</em> at a rate of -0.119 degrees per minute per minute.  That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate.  At \(t = 31\), we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.</li>
<li id="li-397">The potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of \(F\) are falling.  Equivalently, this is because the value of \(F''(t)\) is negative throughout the given time interval.</li>
