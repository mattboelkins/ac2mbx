</h5>By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between \(y = v(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis on \([0,1]\) and \([1,2]\) (each of which is \(1\)), it follows that the object's total distance traveled is \(2\), while its change in position is \(0\).  The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by \(v\) on \([0,2]\) is \(1 - 1 = 0\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_4.1.VelocityDistance.html#li-1621">in-context</a></span>
