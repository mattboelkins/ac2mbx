To this point, most of our studies in calculus have dealt with continuous information (e.g., continuous functions). The major difference we will see now is that sequences model <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">discrete</em> instead of continuous information. We will study ways to represent and work with discrete information in this chapter as we investigate <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">sequences</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">series</em>, and ultimately see key connections between the discrete and continuous.
