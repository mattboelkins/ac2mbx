<li id="li-298">The total cost of producing 2000 feet of rope is \(\ldots\)</li>
<li id="li-299">Remember that the units on any derivative are “units of output per unit of input” and that the input here is \(r\) feet.</li>
<li id="li-300">Since \(C'(2000) = 0.35\) dollars/foot, we expect that for each additional foot of rope, the cost will increase by \(0.35\) dollars.</li>
<li id="li-301">In manufacturing processes, there is often a decrease in cost per unit as the number of units increases.  What does that tell us to expect about the derivative of \(C(r)\)?</li>
<li id="li-302">If \(C'(5000) = -0.1\), this would tell us that \(C(r)\) is a decreasing function at \(r = 5000\), which means that the total cost to make \(5001\) feet of rope is less than the total cost to make \(5000\) feet of rope.  Is this possible?</li>
