There are several important things to observe about the result that \(\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}\). First, this expression for the derivative involves both \(x\) and \(y\). It makes sense that this should be the case, since for each value of \(x\) between \(-4\) and \(4\), there are two corresponding points on the circle, and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points. Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles. If we consider the radius from the origin to the point \((a,b)\), the slope of this line segment is \(m_r = \frac{b}{a}\). The tangent line to the circle at \((a,b)\) will be perpendicular to the radius, and thus have slope \(m_t = -\frac{a}{b}\), as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.7.Circle.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.7.Circle" alt="Figure 2.7.2 " title="Figure 2.7.2 ">FigureÂ 2.7.2</a>. Finally, the slope of the tangent line is zero at \((0,4)\) and \((0,-4)\), and is undefined at \((-4,0)\) and \((4,0)\); all of these values are consistent with the formula \(\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}\).
