To that end, let's suppose that we have a sump crock that has the shape of a frustum of a cone, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F_6.4.Crock.html" knowl-id="xref-F_6.4.Crock" alt="Figure 6.4.4 " title="Figure 6.4.4 ">FigureÂ 6.4.4</a>. Assume that the crock has a diameter of 3 feet at its surface, a diameter of 1.5 feet at its base, and a depth of 4 feet. In addition, suppose that the sump pump is set up so that it pumps the water vertically up a pipe to a drain that is located at ground level just outside a basement window. To accomplish this, the pump must send the water to a location 9 feet above the surface of the sump crock.
