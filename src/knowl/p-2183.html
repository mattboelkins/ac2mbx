More generally, suppose we have two series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) with positive terms and we know the behavior of the series \(\sum a_k\). Recall that the convergence or divergence of a series depends only on what happens to the terms of the series for large values of \(k\), so if we know that \(a_k\) and \(b_k\) are essentially proportional to each other for large \(k\), then the two series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\)
should behave the same way. In other words, if there is a positive finite constant \(c\) such that
