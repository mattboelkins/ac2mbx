Explore to see how you can change the window in which the function is viewed, as well as the function itself. You can set the minimum and maximum values of \(x\) by clicking and dragging on the blue points that set the endpoints; you can change the function by typing a new formula in the “f(x)” window at the bottom; and you can adjust the overall window by “panning and zooming” by using the Shift key and the scrolling feature of your mouse. More information on how to pan and zoom can be found at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/Fl}{<tt xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/Fl</tt>}.
