In working with implicit functions, we will often be interested in finding an equation for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) that tells us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a point \((x,y)\). To do so, it will be necessary for us to work with \(y\) while thinking of \(y\) as a function of \(x\), but without being able to write an explicit formula for \(y\) in terms of \(x\). The following preview activity reminds us of some ways we can compute derivatives of functions in settings where the function's formula is not known. For instance, recall the earlier example \(\frac{d}{dx}[e^{u(x)}] = e^{u(x)}u'(x)\).
