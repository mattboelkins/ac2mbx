<li id="li-625">Use the sum rule; think about which functions in the sum are power functions and which are exponential.</li>
<li id="li-626">Use the sum rule together with the constant multiple rule.  Note which functions are exponential and which are powers of \(x\).</li>
<li id="li-627">Recall that \(\sqrt{z} = z^{1/2}\); also rewrite \(\frac{1}{z^4}\) as a power of \(z\).</li>
<li id="li-628">Note that \(\sqrt{53}\), \(\pi\), and \(e^4\) are all constants.</li>
<li id="li-629">Expand the product and combine like terms before attempting to find the derivative.</li>
<li id="li-630">Rewrite the single fraction as a sum of three fractions, and simplify.  That is, note that \(q(x) = \ds \frac{x^3 - x + 2}{x} = \ds \frac{x^3}{x} - \frac{x}{x} + \frac{2}{x}\)</li>
<li id="li-631">Note that “\(a\)” is the independent variable and \(p(a)\) is simply a polynomial in \(a\).</li>
