As the algebraic complexity of the functions we are able to differentiate continues to increase, it is important to remember that all of the derivative's meaning continues to hold. Regardless of the structure of the function \(f\), the value of \(f'(a)\) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at the moment \(x = a\), as well as the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\).
