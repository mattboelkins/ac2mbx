Again, \(E\) is the antiderivative of \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\) that satisfies \(E(0) = 0\). Moreover, the values on the graph of \(y = E(x)\) represent the net-signed area of the region bounded by \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\) from 0 up to \(x\). We see that the value of \(E\) increases rapidly near zero but then levels off as \(x\) increases since there is less and less additional accumulated area bounded by \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\) as \(x\) increases.
