we have the total value in dollars of the shares held. Observe that over time, both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary. The derivative \(N'(t)\) measures the rate at which the number of shares held is changing, while \(S'(t)\) measures the rate at which the value per share is changing. The big question we'd like to answer is: how do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?
