The Integral Test allows us to determine the convergence of an entire family of series: the \(p\)-series. However, we have seen that it is, in general, difficult to integrate functions, so the Integral Test is not one that we can use all of the time. In fact, even for a relatively simple series like \( \sum \frac{k^2+1}{k^4+2k+2}\), the Integral Test is not an option. In this section we will develop a test that we can use to apply to series of rational functions like this by comparing their behavior to the behavior of \(p\)-series.
