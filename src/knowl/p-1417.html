We know from the definition of the definite integral of a continuous function \(f\), that if we let \(n\) be large enough, we can make the value of any of the approximations \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\) as close as we'd like (in theory) to the exact value of \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\). Thus, it may be natural to wonder why we ever use any rule other than \(L_n\) or \(R_n\) (with a sufficiently large \(n\) value) to estimate a definite integral. One of the primary reasons is that as \(n \to \infty\), \(\triangle x = \frac{b-a}{n} \to 0\), and thus in a Riemann sum calculation with a large \(n\) value, we end up multiplying by a number that is very close to zero. Doing so often generates roundoff error, as representing numbers close to zero accurately is a persistent challenge for computers.
