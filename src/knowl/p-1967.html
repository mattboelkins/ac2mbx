Notice that the graph shows the population leveling off at 12.5 billion, as
we expected, and that the population will be around 10 billion in the
year 2050. These results, which we have found using a relatively simple
mathematical model, agree fairly well with predictions made using a
much more sophisticated model developed by the United Nations.
