but \(g\) does not have a limit as \(x \to 1\). When working graphically, it suffices to ask if the function approaches a single value from each side of the fixed input, while understanding that the function value right at the fixed input is irrelevant. This reasoning explains the values of the first three stated limits. In a situation such as the jump in the graph of \(g\) at \(x = 1\), the issue is that if we approach \(x = 1\) from the left, the function values tend to get as close to 3 as we'd like, but if we approach \(x = 1\) from the right, the function values get as close to 2 as we'd like, and there is no single number that all of these function values approach. This is why the limit of \(g\) does not exist at \(x = 1\).
