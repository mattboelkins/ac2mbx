The chain rule now joins the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules in our collection of the different techniques for finding the derivative of a function through understanding its algebraic structure and the basic functions that constitute it. It takes substantial practice to get comfortable with navigating multiple rules in a single problem; using proper notation and taking a few extra steps can be particularly helpful as well. We demonstrate with an example and then provide further opportunity for practice in the following activity.
