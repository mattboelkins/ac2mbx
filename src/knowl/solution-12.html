<li id="li-281">Using the central difference, we find that

	degrees per minute.</li>
<li id="li-282">Over each subsequent time interval, we see that the amount of increase in the potato's temperature gets less and less, thus we expect the value of \(F'(t)\) to get smaller and smaller as time goes on.  We therefore expect \(F'(75) &gt; F'(90)\).</li>
<li id="li-283">The value \(F(64) = 330.28\) is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64, while \(F'(64) = 1.341\) measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant \(t = 64\), and its units are degrees per minute.  Because at time \(t = 64\) the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at \(t = 65\), the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at \(t = 64\), or in other words \(F(65) \approx 330.28 + 1.341 = 331.621\).  Similarly, at \(t = 66\), two minutes have elapsed from \(t = 64\), so we expect an increase of \(2 \dot 1.341\) degrees:  \(F(66) \approx 330.28 + 2 \cdot 1.341 = 332.962\).</li>
<li id="li-284">Throughout the time interval \([0,90]\), the temperature \(F\) of the potato is increasing.  But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing.  That is, while the values of \(F\) continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of \(F'\) are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that “the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.”</li>
