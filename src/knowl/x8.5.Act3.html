<li id="li-3117">Plot the graphs of several of the Taylor polynomials centered at 0 (of order at least 5) for \(e^x\) and convince yourself that these Taylor polynomials converge to \(e^x\) for every value of \(x\).</li>
<li id="li-3118">Draw the graphs of several of the Taylor polynomials centered at 0 (of order at least 6) for \(\cos(x)\) and convince yourself that these Taylor polynomials converge to \(\cos(x)\) for every value of \(x\). Write the Taylor series centered at 0 for \(\cos(x)\).</li>
<li id="li-3119">Draw the graphs of several of the Taylor polynomials centered at 0 for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\). Based on your graphs, for what values of \(x\)  do these Taylor polynomials appear to converge to \(\frac{1}{1-x}\)? How is this situation different from what we observe with \(e^x\) and \(\cos(x)\)?  In addition, write the Taylor series centered at 0 for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\).</li>
