Suppose the pool has been emptied and is now being filled with water at a rate of 800 cubic feet per minute. At what rate is the depth of water (measured at the deepest point of the pool) increasing when it is 5 feet deep at that end? Over time, describe how the depth of the water will increase: at an increasing rate, at a decreasing rate, or at a constant rate. Explain.	
	
	\item A baseball diamond is a square with sides 90 feet long. Suppose a baseball player is advancing from second to third base at the rate of 24 feet per second, and an umpire is standing on home plate. Let \(\theta\) be the angle between the third baseline and the line of sight from the umpire to the runner. How fast is \(\theta\) changing when the runner is 30 feet from third base?
	
	\item Sand is being dumped off a conveyor belt onto a pile in such a way that the pile forms in the shape of a cone whose radius is always equal to its height. Assuming that the sand is being dumped at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute, how fast is the height of the pile changing when there are 1000 cubic feet on the pile?
