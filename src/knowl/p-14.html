At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, as well as how each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function. In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal, we will introduce the notion of <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">limit</em> in <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html" alt="Section 1.2 The notion of limit" title="Section 1.2 The notion of limit">SectionÂ 1.2</a>. As a preview of that concept, we look at a way to consider the limiting value of average velocity through the introduction of a parameter. Note that if we desire to know the instantaneous velocity at \(t = a\) of a moving object with position function \(s\), we are interested in computing average velocities on the interval \([a,b]\) for smaller and smaller intervals. One way to visualize this is to think of the value \(b\) as being \(b = a + h\), where \(h\) is a small number that is allowed to vary. Thus, we observe that the average velocity of the object on the interval \([a,a+h]\) is
