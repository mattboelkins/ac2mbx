This rule for the natural logarithm function now joins our list of other basic derivative rules that we have already established. There are two particularly interesting things to note about the fact that \(\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}\). One is that this rule is restricted to only apply to positive values of \(x\), as these are the only values for which the original function is defined. The other is that for the first time in our work, differentiating a basic function of a particular type has led to a function of a very different nature: the derivative of the natural logarithm is not another logarithm, nor even an exponential function, but rather a rational one.
