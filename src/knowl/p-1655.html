While there are many different formulas that we use in solving problems involving work, force, and pressure, it is important to understand that the fundamental ideas behind these problems are similar to several others that we've encountered in applications of the definite integral. In particular, the basic idea is to take a difficult problem and somehow slice it into more manageable pieces that we understand, and then use a definite integral to add up these simpler pieces.
