Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the derivative involves a limit, there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits. In addition, the limit involved in the limit definition of the derivative is one that always generates an indeterminate form of \(\frac{0}{0}\). If \(f\) is a differentiable function for which \(f'(x)\) exists, then when we consider
