Throughout <a href="C_2.html" alt="Chapter 2 Computing Derivatives" title="Chapter 2 Computing Derivatives">Chapter 2</a>, we will be working to develop shortcut derivative rules that will help us to bypass the limit definition of the derivative in order to quickly determine the formula for \(f'(x)\) when we are given a formula for \(f(x)\). In <a href="S_2.1.ElemRules.html" alt="Section 2.1 Elementary derivative rules" title="Section 2.1 Elementary derivative rules">Section 2.1</a>, we learned the rule for power functions, that if \(f(x) = x^n\), then \(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\), and justified this in part due to results from different \(n\)-values when applying the limit definition of the derivative. We also stated the rule for exponential functions, that if \(a\) is a positive real number annd \(f(x) = a^x\), then \(f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)\). Later in this present section, we are going to work to conjecture formulas for the sine and cosine functions, primarily through a graphical argument. To help set the stage for doing so, the following preview activity asks you to think about exponential functions and why it is reasonable to think that the derivative of an exponential function is a constant times the exponential function itself.
