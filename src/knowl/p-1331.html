neither \(u\)-substitution nor Integration by Parts proves fruitful. While there are other integration techniques, some of which we will consider briefly, none of them enables us to find an algebraic antiderivative for \(e^{x^2}\) or \(x \tan(x)\). There are at least two key observations to make: one, we do know from the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that we can construct an integral antiderivative for each function; and two, antidifferentiation is much, much harder in general than differentiation. In particular, we observe that \(F(x) = \int_0^x e^{t^2} \, dt\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = e^{x^2}\), and \(G(x) = \int_0^{x} t \tan(t) \, dt\) is an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x \tan(x)\). But finding an elementary algebraic formula that doesn't involve integrals for either \(F\) or \(G\) turns out not only to be impossible through \(u\)-substitution or Integration by Parts, but indeed impossible altogether.
