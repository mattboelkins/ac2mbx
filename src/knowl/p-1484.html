To see how we find such a definite integral that measures arc length on the curve \(y = f(x)\) from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\), we think about the portion of length, \(L_{\mbox{{slice}} }\), that lies along the curve on a small interval of length \(\triangle x\), and estimate the value of \(L{\mbox{{slice}} }\) using a well-chosen triangle. In particular, if we consider the right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes and hypotenuse connecting two points on the curve, as seen at right in <a knowl="./knowl/F_6.1.ArcLength.html" knowl-id="xref-F_6.1.ArcLength" alt="Figure 6.1.7 " title="Figure 6.1.7 ">FigureÂ 6.1.7</a>, we see that the length, \(h\), of the hypotenuse approximates the length, \(L_{\mbox{{slice}} }\), of the curve between the two selected points. Thus,
