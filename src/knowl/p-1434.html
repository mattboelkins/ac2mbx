The rule for \(S_n\) giving by <a knowl="./knowl/E_Simpson.html" knowl-id="xref-E_Simpson" alt="Equation 5.6.5 " title="Equation 5.6.5 ">Equation (5.6.5)</a> is usually known as <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Simpson's Rule</em>.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-39" id="fn-39"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 2 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-39" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Thomas Simpson was an 18th century mathematician; his idea was to extend the Trapezoid rule, but rather than using straight lines to build trapezoids, to use quadratic functions to build regions whose area was bounded by parabolas (whose areas he could find exactly).  Simpson's Rule is often developed from the more sophisticated perspective of using interpolation by quadratic functions.</span></span> We build upon the results in <a knowl="./knowl/T_5.6.Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-T_5.6.Ex2" alt="Figure 5.6.6 " title="Figure 5.6.6 ">Table 5.6.6</a> to see the approximations generated by Simpson's Rule. In particular, in <a knowl="./knowl/T_5.6.Ex3.html" knowl-id="xref-T_5.6.Ex3" alt="Figure 5.6.7 " title="Figure 5.6.7 ">Table 5.6.7</a>, we include all of the results in <a knowl="./knowl/T_5.6.Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-T_5.6.Ex2" alt="Figure 5.6.6 " title="Figure 5.6.6 ">Table 5.6.6</a>, but include additional results for \(S_4 = \frac{2M_4 + T_4}{3}\) and \(S_8 = \frac{2M_8 + T_8}{3}\).
