</h5>Since the numerator is always 1 more than the denominator, a formula for \(s_n\) is \(s_n = \frac{n+1}{n}\). A plot of the first 50 points in the sequence is shown here.
Since we can make the values of \(\frac{n+1}{n}\) in our sequence as close to 1 as we want by choosing \(n\) to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence has a limit of 1 as \(n\) goes to infinity.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_8.1.Sequences.html#li-2738">in-context</a></span>
