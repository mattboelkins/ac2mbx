While we completely understand where \(f\) is increasing and decreasing, where \(f\) is concave up and concave down, and where \(f\) has relative extremes, we do not know any specific information about the \(y\)-coordinates of points on the curve. For instance, while we know that \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{3}\), we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know \(f(-\sqrt{3})\). Any vertical translation of our sketch of \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.Ex2" alt="Figure 3.1.11 " title="Figure 3.1.11 ">FigureÂ 3.1.11</a> would satisfy the given criteria for \(f\).
