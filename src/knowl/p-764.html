We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down. Each of these approaches provides us with key information that helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph, as well as whether the function has a relative minimum or relative maximum at a given critical number. Remember that the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum is that there is a relative minimum of \(f\) at \(x = p\) if \(f(p) \ge f(x)\) for all \(x\) near \(p\), while there is a global maximum at \(p\) if \(f(p) \ge f(x)\) for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f\).
