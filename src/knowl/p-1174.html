Here we see that the First FTC can be viewed from at least two perspectives: first, as a tool to find the difference \(F(b) - F(a)\) for an antiderivative \(F\) of the integrand \(f\). In this situation, we need to be able to determine the value of the integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly, perhaps through known geometric formulas for area. It is possible that we may not have a formula for \(F\) itself. From a second perspective, the First FTC provides a way to find the exact value of a definite integral, and hence a certain net-signed area exactly, by finding an antiderivative of the integrand and evaluating its total change over the interval. In this latter case, we need to know a formula for the antiderivative \(F\), as this enables us to compute net-signed areas exactly through definite integrals, as demonstrated in <a knowl="./knowl/F_5.2.Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F_5.2.Intro" alt="Figure 5.2.1 " title="Figure 5.2.1 ">FigureÂ 5.2.1</a>.
