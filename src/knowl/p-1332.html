\item Through the method of Integration by Parts, we can evaluate indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions such as \(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\) and \(\int x \ln(x) \, dx\) through a substitution that enables us to effectively trade one of the functions in the product for its derivative, and the other for its antiderivative, in an effort to find a different product of functions that is easier to integrate.
\item If we are given an integral whose algebraic structure we can identify as a product of basic functions in the form \(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\), we can use the substitution \(u = f(x)\) and \(dv = g'(x) \,dx\) and apply the rule
