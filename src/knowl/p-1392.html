\item The method of partial fractions enables any rational function to be antidifferentiated, because any polynomial function can be factored into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic terms. This allows any rational function to be written as the sum of a polynomial plus rational terms of the form \(\frac{A}{(x-c)^n}\) (where \(n\) is a natural number) and \(\frac{Bx+C}{x^2 + k}\) (where \(k\) is a positive real number).
\item Until the development of computing algebra systems, integral tables enabled students of calculus to more easily evaluate integrals such as \(\int \sqrt{a^2 + u^2} \, du\), where \(a\) is a positive real number. A short table of integrals may be found in <a href="C_9.IntegralTable.html" alt="Chapter 9 A Short Table of Integrals" title="Chapter 9 A Short Table of Integrals">AppendixÂ 9</a>.
\item Computer algebra systems can play an important role in finding antiderivatives, though we must be cautious to use correct input, to watch for unusual or unfamiliar advanced functions that the CAS may cite in its result, and to consider the possibility that a CAS may need further assistance or insight from us in order to answer a particular question.
