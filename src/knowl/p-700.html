Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself. For instance, if \(f''\) is positive on an interval, then we know that \(f'\) is increasing on that interval and, consequently, that \(f\) is concave up, which also tells us that throughout the interval the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) lies below the curve at every point. In this situation where we know that \(f'(p) = 0\), it turns out that the sign of the second derivative determines whether \(f\) has a local minimum or local maximum at the critical number \(p\).
