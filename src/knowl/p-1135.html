In what follows, we explore these issues still further, with a particular emphasis on the situation where we possess an accurate graph of the derivative function along with a single value of the function \(f\). From that information, we desire to completely determine an accurate graph of \(f\) that not only represents correctly where \(f\) is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down, but also allows us to find an accurate function value at any point of interest to us.
