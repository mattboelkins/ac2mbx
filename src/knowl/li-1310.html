</h5>Noting that \(h'(x) = abe^{-bx}\), we see that if we consider different values of \(b\), the slope of the graph changes.  If \(b\) is large and \(x\) is close to zero, \(h'(x) \approx ab\) (since \(e^0 = 1\)), so \(h'(x)\) is relatively large near \(x = 0\).  At the same time, for large \(b\), \(e^{-bx}\) approaches zero quickly as \(x\) increases, so the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as \(x\) increases.  If \(b\) is small, the graph is less steep near \(x = 0\) and its slope goes to zero less quickly as \(x\) increases.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.2.Families.html#li-1310">in-context</a></span>
