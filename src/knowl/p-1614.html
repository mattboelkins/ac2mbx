Finally, when we recently learned about the mass of an object of non-constant density, we saw that since \(M = D \cdot V\) (mass equals density times volume, provided that density is constant), if we can consider a small slice of an object on which the density is approximately constant, a definite integral may be used to determine the exact mass of the object. For instance, if we have a thin rod whose cross sections have constant density, but whose density is distributed along the \(x\) axis according to the function \(y = \rho(x)\), it follows that for a small slice of the rod that is \(\triangle x\) thick, \(M_{\mbox{{slice}} } = \rho(x) \triangle x\). In the limit as \(\triangle x \to 0\), we then find that the total mass is given by
