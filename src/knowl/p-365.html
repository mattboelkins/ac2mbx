The results of the two preceding activities suggest that the sine and cosine functions not only have the beautiful interrelationships that are learned in a course in trigonometry – connections such as the identities \(\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1\) and \(\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(x)\) – but that they are even further linked through calculus, as the derivative of each involves the other. The following rules summarize the results of the activities<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-13" id="fn-13"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-13" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">These two rules may be formally proved using the limit definition of the derivative and the expansion identities for \(\sin(x+h)\) and \(\cos(x+h)\).</span></span>.
