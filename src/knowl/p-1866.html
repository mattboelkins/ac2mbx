There is one more slightly technical point to make. Notice that \(y=0\)
is an equilibrium solution to this differential equation. In solving
the equation above, we begin by dividing both sides by \(y\), which
is not allowed if \(y=0\). To be perfectly careful, therefore, we will typically
consider the equilibrium solutions separably. In this case, notice that the final
form of our solution captures the equilibrium solution by allowing
\(C=0\).
