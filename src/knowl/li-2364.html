</h5>From physics, <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Hooke's Law</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;Hooke's Law\lt /main&gt;} for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed (or extended) to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed (or extended) from its natural length.  That is, the force to compress (or extend) a spring \(x\) units from its natural length is \(F(x) = kx\) for some constant \(k\) (which is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">spring constant</em>.) For springs, we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet.
	
	Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.
