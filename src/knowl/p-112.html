\item The average rate of change of a function \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\) is \(\ds \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\). The units on the average rate of change are units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\), and the numerical value of the average rate of change represents the slope of the secant line between the points \((a,f(a))\) and \((b,f(b))\) on the graph of \(y = f(x)\). If we view the interval as being \([a,a+h]\) instead of \([a,b]\), the meaning is still the same, but the average rate of change is now computed by \(\ds \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\).
\item The instantaneous rate of change with respect to \(x\) of a function \(f\) at a value \(x = a\) is denoted \(f'(a)\) (read “the derivative of \(f\) evaluated at \(a\)” or “\(f\)-prime at \(a\)”) and is defined by the formula
