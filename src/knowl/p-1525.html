Immediately we see a major difference between the solid in this example and the one in <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_6.2.Disks.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_6.2.Disks" alt="Example 6.2.3 " title="Example 6.2.3 ">Example 6.2.3</a>: here, the three-dimensional solid of revolution isn't “solid” in the sense that it has open space in its center. If we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution, we observe that in this setting the resulting representative slice is not a solid disk, but rather a <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">washer</em>, as pictured at right in <a knowl="./knowl/F_6.2.Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-F_6.2.Ex2" alt="Figure 6.2.6 " title="Figure 6.2.6 ">Figure 6.2.6</a>. Moreover, at a given location \(x\) between \(x = -2\) and \(x = 1\), the small radius \(r(x)\) of the inner circle is determined by the curve \(y = x+2\), so \(r(x) = x+2\). Similarly, the big radius \(R(x)\) comes from the function \(y = 4-x^2\), and thus \(R(x) = 4-x^2\).
