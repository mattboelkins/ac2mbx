Note particularly how we distinguish between the notations \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) and \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\). The former represents the rate of change of \(r\) with respect to \(t\) at an arbitrary value of \(t\), while the latter is the rate of change of \(r\) with respect to \(t\) at a particular moment, in fact the moment \(r = 4\). While we don't know the exact value of \(t\), because information is provided about the value of \(r\), it is important to distinguish that we are using this more specific data.
