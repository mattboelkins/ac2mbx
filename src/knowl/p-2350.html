Preview <a href="S_8.5.Taylor.html#PA_8.5" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> illustrates the first steps in the process of approximating complicated functions with polynomials. Using this process we can approximate trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and other nonpolynomial functions as closely as we like (for certain values of \(x\)) with polynomials. This is extraordinarily useful in that it allows us to calculate values of these functions to whatever precision we like using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are operations that can be easily programmed in a computer.
