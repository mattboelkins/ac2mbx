In general, we understand the notation \(\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\) to mean that we can make \(f(x)\) as large as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to \(a\), and the notation \(\ds \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\) to mean that we can make \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently large. This notation applies to left- and right-hand limits, plus we can also use limits involving \(-\infty\). For example, returning to <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.8.Infty.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.8.Infty" alt="Figure 2.8.6 " title="Figure 2.8.6 ">FigureÂ 2.8.6</a> and \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\), we can say that
