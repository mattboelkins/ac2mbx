<span class="solution"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Hint</span> <span class="codenumber">1.4.2.2</span></span>Points where the slope of the tangent line is equal to zero are particularly important.  Try finding these points first in your effort to plot \(y = f'(x)\) and plotting those zero values on the axes where you'll graph \(y = f'(x)\).  After doing so, think carefully as well about the questions: at this point, is \(f'(x)\) positive or negative?  is \(f'(x)\) big or small.  Use these ideas to help you sketch the derivative graph for the following functions.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.4.DerivativeFxn.html#hint-20">in-context</a></span>
