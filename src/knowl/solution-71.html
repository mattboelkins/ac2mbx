<li id="li-1782">The curve \(y = v(t) = \sqrt{4-(t-2)^2}\) is the top half of the circle \((t-2)^2 + y^2 = 4\), which has radius 2 and is centered at \((2,0)\).</li>
<li id="li-1783">Thus, the value of \(\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt\) is the area of a semicircle of radius 2, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi\).</li>
<li id="li-1784">Because the velocity \(v(t)\) is always nonnegative in this problem, the meaning of \(\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = 2\pi\) is both the distance traveled and the change in position of the object on the interval \(0 \le t \le \pi\).  Specifically, the object moved \(2 \pi\) meters in 4 minutes.</li>
<li id="li-1785">We know \(v_{\mbox{\tiny{AVG}} }[a,b] = \frac{1}{b-a}  \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\), so
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-454">\[
v_{\mbox{\tiny{AVG}} }[0,4] = \frac{1}{4-0}  \int_0^4 \sqrt{4-(t-2)^2} \, dt = \frac{1}{4} 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2},
\]</span>
 
	which is measured in meters per minute, since the units on “4” are minutes and on “\(2\pi\)” are meters.</li>
<li id="li-1786">Constructing a figure similar to those shown in this section on the topic of average value of a function, we find the following, which demonstrates a rectangle having the same area as the semicircle.
	<img width="100%" src="images/4_3_Act3Soln.png"> 
	The height of the rectangle is the average value of \(v\), specifically \(v_{\mbox{\tiny{AVG}} }[0,4] = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57\).</li>
<li id="li-1787">Knowing that average velocity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), it follows from the fact that distance traveled equals average rate times time (provided velocity is always nonnegative), we have
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-455">\[
D = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 4 = 2\pi.
\]</span>
 
	We see from (c) or (f) that we are simply considering the situation from two different perspectives: if we know the distance traveled, we can find average velocity, or if we know average velocity, we can find distance traveled.</li>
