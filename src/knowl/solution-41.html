<li id="li-1109">To find where the tangent line to the curve is horizontal, we set \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\), which requires that the numerator be zero, or in other words that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-239">\[
(x-1)(x-2) + x(x-2) + x(x-1) = 0.
\]</span>
 
	Expanding and combining like terms, we find that \(3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\), which occurs where \(x = \frac{3\pm\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 0.42265, 1.57735\). From the graph in <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.7.Act2.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.7.Act2" alt="Figure 2.7.8 " title="Figure 2.7.8 ">FigureÂ 2.7.8</a>, we observe that at each such \(x\)-value, there are several corresponding \(y\)-values for which the tangent line will be horizontal.  For instance, when \(x = 0.42265\), then \(y\) must satisfy the equation
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-240">\[
y(y^2-1)(y-2) = 0.42265(0.42265-1)(0.42265-2) = 0.384900.
\]</span>
 
	Because this is a quartic equation (degree 4) equation in \(y\), we use computational technology to help us find the solutions.  Doing so, we find four approximate values for \(y\), \(y \approx -1.05782, 0.229478, 0.770522, 2.05782\), and thus our estimates for four points at which the tangent line is horizontal are
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-241">\[
(0.42265, -1.05782); (0.42265, 0.229478);  (0.42265, 0.770522); (0.42265, 2.05782).
\]</span>
 
	Similar work can be done to find the four points at which the tangent line is horizontal when \(x \approx 1.57735\).</li>
<li id="li-1110">The tangent line to the curve is vertical wherever \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is undefined, which occurs precisely where 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-242">\[
(y^2-1)(y-2) + 2y^2(y-2) + y(y^2-1) = 0.
\]</span>
 
	Expanding and combining like terms, we see that we need to solve the cubic equation \(4y^3 - 6y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0\); using a computer algebra system, we find that this occurs when \(y = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.\)  It now remains to find the \(x\)-coordinate that corresponds to each such \(y\)-value.  For instance, when \(y = \frac{1}{2}\), \(x\) must satisfy
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-243">\[
\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{4}-1)(\frac{1}{2}-2) = x(x-1)(x-2),
\]</span>
 
	or in other words, \(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x = \frac{9}{16}.\)  Here, too, we use technology to determine that there is only one such \(x\), and \(x \approx 2.21028\).  Similar work can be done to find the \(x\)-values that correspond to \(y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\).</li>
<li id="li-1111">There are four points on the curve where \(x = 1\), which correspond to the \(y\)-values that satisfy \(y(y^2-1)(y-2) = 0\): \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), \((1,-1)\), \((1,2)\).  We choose the point \((1,1)\) and evaluate \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) at this point.  Doing so,
	  
<span class="displaymath" id="me-244">\[
\left.\frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(1,1)} = \frac{(1-1)(1-2) + 1(1-2) + 1(1-1)}{(1^2-1)(1-2) + 2\cdot 1^2(1-2) + 1(1^2-1)} = \frac{-1}{-2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]</span>
 
Thus, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at \((1,1)\) is \(y - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(x-1)\).</li>
