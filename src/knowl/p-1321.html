Observe that the integral on the right in EquationÂ <a knowl="./knowl/E_IBPtwice.html" knowl-id="xref-E_IBPtwice" alt="Equation 5.4.4 " title="Equation 5.4.4 ">(5.4.4)</a>, \(\int e^t \sin(t) \, dt\), while not being more complicated than the original integral we want to evaluate, it is essentially identical to \(\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt\). While the overall situation isn't necessarily better than what we started with, the problem hasn't gotten worse. Thus, we proceed by integrating by parts again. This time we let \(u = \sin(t)\) and \(dv = e^t \, dt\), so that \(du = \cos(t) \, dt\) and \(v = e^t\), which implies
