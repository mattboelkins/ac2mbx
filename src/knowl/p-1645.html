Most people know from experience that the deeper one dives underwater while swimming, the greater the pressure that is exerted by the water. This is due to the fact that the deeper one dives, the more water there is right on top of the swimmer: it is the force that “column” of water exerts that determines the pressure the swimmer experiences. To get water pressure measured in its standard units (pounds per square foot), we say that the total water pressure is found by computing the total weight of the column of water that lies above a region of area 1 square foot at a fixed depth. Such a rectangular column with a \(1 \times 1\) base and a depth of \(d\) feet has volume \(V = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot d\) ft\(^3\), and thus the corresponding weight of the water overhead is \(62.4d\). Since this is also the amount of force being exerted on a 1 square foot region at a depth \(d\) feet underwater, we see that \(P = 62.4 d\) (lbs/ft\(^2\)) is the pressure exerted by water at depth \(d\).
