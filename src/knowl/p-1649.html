It is essential to use the fact that pressure is constant at a fixed depth. Hence, we consider a slice of water at constant depth on the face, such as the one shown in the figure. First, the approximate area of this slice is the area of the pictured rectangle. Since the width of that rectangle depends on the variable \(x\) (which represents the how far the slice lies from the top of the dam), we find a formula for the function \(y = f(x)\) that determines one side of the face of the dam. Since \(f\) is linear, it is straightforward to find that \(y = f(x) = 45 - \frac{3}{5}x\). Hence, the approximate area of a representative slice is
