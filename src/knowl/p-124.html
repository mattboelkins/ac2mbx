Given a function \(y = f(x)\), we now know that if we are interested in the instantaneous rate of change of the function at \(x = a\), or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) at \(x = a\), we can compute the value \(f'(a)\). In all of our examples to date, we have arbitrarily identified a particular value of \(a\) as our point of interest: \(a = 1\), \(a = 3\), etc. But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one \(a\)-value, and possibly for many of them. In this section, we explore how we can move from computing simply \(f'(1)\) or \(f'(3)\) to working more generally with \(f'(a)\), and indeed \(f'(x)\). Said differently, we will work toward understanding how the so-called process of “taking the derivative” generates a new function that is derived from the original function \(y = f(x)\). The following preview activity starts us down this path.
