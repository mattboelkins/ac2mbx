</h5>Suppose that a shelf is 6 feet long, with its left end situated at \(x = 0\).  If one book of weight 1 lb is placed at \(x_1 = 0\), and another book of weight 1 lb is placed at \(x_2 = 6\), what is the location of \(\overline{x}\), the point at which the shelf would (theoretically) balance on a fulcrum?</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_6.3.Mass.html#li-2317">in-context</a></span>
