</h5>The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second. As part (a) illustrates, sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">aliasing</em>). There is an elegant  theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited, which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information. This theorem also provides the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">lowest</em> rate at which a signal can be sampled (called the Nyquist rate) without such a loss of information. The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points.

        Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period. Identify the frequency of the function \(f\) and determine the number of partitions of the interval \([0,10]\) that give us the Nyquist rate.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_8.1.Sequences.html#li-2769">in-context</a></span>
