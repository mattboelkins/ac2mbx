Consider the question posed by this initial value problem: “what function do we know that is the same as its own
derivative and has value 1 when \(t=0\)?” It is not hard to see that the
solution is \(y(t) = e^t\). We now apply Euler's method
to approximate \(y(1) = e\) using several values of \(\Delta t\). These
approximations will be denoted by \(E_{\Delta t}\), and these estimates provide us a way to see how accurate Euler's Method is.
