The kind of work we've completed in <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_3.2.1.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_3.2.1" alt="Example 3.2.2 " title="Example 3.2.2 ">ExampleÂ 3.2.2</a> can often be replicated for other families of functions that depend on parameters. Normally we are most interested in determining all critical numbers, a first derivative sign chart, a second derivative sign chart, and some analysis of the limit of the function as \(x \to \infty\). Throughout, we strive to work with the parameters as arbitrary constants. If stuck, it is always possible to experiment with some particular values of the parameters present to reduce the algebraic complexity of our work. The following sequence of activities offers several key examples where we see that the values of different parameters substantially affect the behavior of individual functions within a given family.
