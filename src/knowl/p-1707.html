In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">differential equations</em> and explore
this idea in more depth. Simply said, a differential equation is an equation that provides a
description of a function's derivative, which means that it tells us
the function's rate of change. Using this information, we would like
to learn as much as possible about the function itself. For instance,
we would ideally like to have an algebraic description of the
function. As we'll see, this may be too much to ask in some
situations, but we will still be able to make accurate approximations.
