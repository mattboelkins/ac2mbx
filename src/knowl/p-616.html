\item When we have an equation involving \(x\) and \(y\) where \(y\) cannot be solved for explicitly in terms of \(x\), but where portions of the curve can be thought of as being generated by explicit functions of \(x\), we say that \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\). A good example of such a curve is the unit circle.
\item In the process of implicit differentiation, we take the equation that generates an implicitly given curve and differentiate both sides with respect to \(x\) while treating \(y\) as a function of \(x\). In so doing, the chain rule leads \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) to arise, and then we may subsequently solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) using algebra.
\item While \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) may now involve both the variables \(x\) and \(y\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) still measures the slope of the tangent line to the curve, and thus this derivative may be used to decide when the tangent line is horizontal (\(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\)) or vertical (\(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is undefined), or to find the equation of the tangent line at a particular point on the curve.
