Moreover, from this foundational problem involving position and velocity we have learned a great deal. Given a differentiable function \(f\), we are now able to find its derivative and use this derivative to determine the function's instantaneous rate of change at any point in the domain, as well as to find where the function is increasing or decreasing, is concave up or concave down, and has relative extremes. The vast majority of the problems and applications we have considered have involved the situation where a particular function is known and we seek information that relies on knowing the function's instantaneous rate of change. That is, we have typically proceeded from a function \(f\) to its derivative, \(f'\), and then used the meaning of the derivative to help us answer important questions.
