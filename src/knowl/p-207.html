In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.6.concavity.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.6.concavity" alt="Figure 1.6.8 " title="Figure 1.6.8 ">Figure 1.6.8</a>, we see two functions along with a sequence of tangent lines to each. On the lefthand plot where the function is concave up, observe that the tangent lines to the curve always lie below the curve itself and that, as we move from left to right, the slope of the tangent line is increasing. Said differently, the function \(f\) is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative, \(f'\), is increasing on that interval. Similarly, on the righthand plot in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.6.concavity.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.6.concavity" alt="Figure 1.6.8 " title="Figure 1.6.8 ">Figure 1.6.8</a>, where the function shown is concave down, there we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve and that the value of the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as we move from left to right. Hence, what makes \(f\) concave down on the interval is the fact that its derivative, \(f'\), is decreasing.
