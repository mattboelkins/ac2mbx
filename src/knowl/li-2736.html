</h5>By observation we see that a formula for \(s_n\) is \(s_n = n\). A plot of the first 50 points in the sequence is shown here.
We recalling that a function \(f\) has a limit \(L\) at infinity if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) as large as we want by choosing \(x\) as large as we need. Since we can make the values of \(n\) in our sequence as large as we want by choosing \(n\) to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence does not have a limit as \(n\) goes to infinity.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_8.1.Sequences.html#li-2736">in-context</a></span>
