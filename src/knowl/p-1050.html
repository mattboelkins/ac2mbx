where \(\triangle x = \frac{b-a}{n}\), \(x_i = a + i\triangle x\) (for \(i = 0, \ldots, n\)), and \(x_i^*\) satisfies \(x_{i-1} \le x_i^* \le x_i\) (for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\)).
\item The definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \,dx\) measures the exact net signed area bounded by \(f\) and the horizontal axis on \([a,b]\); in addition, the value of the definite integral is related to what we call the average value of the function on \([a,b]\): \(f_{\mbox{\tiny{AVG}} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \cdot \int_a^b f(x) \, dx.\) In the setting where we consider the integral of a velocity function \(v\), \(\int_a^b v(t) \,dt\) measures the exact change in position of the moving object on \([a,b]\); when \(v\) is nonnegative, \(\int_a^b v(t) \,dt\) is the object's distance traveled on \([a,b]\).
\item The definite integral is a sophisticated sum, and thus has some of the same natural properties that finite sums have. Perhaps most important of these is how the definite integral respects sums and constant multiples of functions, which can be summarized by the rule
