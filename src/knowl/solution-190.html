<li id="li-3123">The graphs of the 10th (magenta), 20th (blue), and 30th (green) Taylor polynomials centered at 0 for \(\cos(x)\) are shown below along with the graph of \(f(x)\) in red:

It appears that as we increase the order of the Taylor polynomials, they fit the graph of \(f\) better and better over larger intervals. So it looks like the Taylor polynomials converge to \(\cos(x)\) for every value of \(x\).
Based on the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomials we found earlier for \(\cos(x)\), the Taylor series for \(f(x)\) centered at 0 is

\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!}.

<li id="li-3124">The graphs of the 10th (magenta), 20th (blue), and 30th (green) Taylor polynomials centered at 0 for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) are shown below along with the graph of \(f(x)\) in red:
\resizebox{!}{1.75in}{<img width="100%" src="images/8_5_1over1minusx_graphs.png"> } 

It appears that as we increase the order of the Taylor polynomials, they only fit the graph of \(f\) better and better over the interval \((-1,1)\) and appear to diverge outside that interval. So it looks like the Taylor polynomials converge to \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) only on the interval \((-1,1)\).

Based on the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomials we found earlier for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\), the Taylor series for \(f(x)\) centered at 0 is

<span class="displaymath" id="me-1030">\[
