\item If we assume that the rate of growth of a population is
proportional to the population, we are led to a model in which the
population grows without bound and at a rate that grows without bound.
\item By assuming that the per capita growth rate decreases as the
population grows, we are led to the logistic model of population
growth, which predicts that the population will eventually
stabilize at the carrying capacity.
