A recurring theme in our discussion of differential calculus has been the question “Given information about the derivative of an unknown function \(f\), how much information can we obtain about \(f\) itself?” For instance, in <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.8.2.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.8.2" alt="Exercise 1.8.6 " title="Exercise 1.8.6 ">Activity 1.8.6</a>, we explored the situation where the graph of \(y = f'(x)\) was known (along with the value of \(f\) at a single point) and endeavored to sketch a possible graph of \(f\) near the known point. In <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_f_from_f_.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_f_from_f_" alt="Example 3.1.4 " title="Example 3.1.4 ">Example 3.1.4</a> – and indeed throughout <a href="S_3.1.Tests.html" alt="Section 3.1 Using derivatives to identify extreme values" title="Section 3.1 Using derivatives to identify extreme values">Section 3.1</a> – we investigated how the first derivative test enables us to use information regarding \(f'\) to determine where the original function \(f\) is increasing and decreasing, as well as where \(f\) has relative extreme values. Further, if we know a formula or graph of \(f'\), by computing \(f''\) we can find where the original function \(f\) is concave up and concave down. Thus, the combination of knowing \(f'\) and \(f''\) enables us to fully understand the shape of the graph of \(f\).
