provided the limit exists. Note particularly that the instantaneous rate of change at \(x = a\) is the limit of the average rate of change on \([a,a+h]\) as \(h \to 0\).
\item Provided the derivative \(f'(a)\) exists, its value tells us the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at \(x = a\), which geometrically is the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\). We even say that \(f'(a)\) is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">slope of the curve</em> \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\).
\item Limits are the link between average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change: they allow us to move from the rate of change over an interval to the rate of change at a single point.
