Because these values of \(c\) are so important, we call them <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">critical numbers</em>. More specifically, we say that a function \(f\) has a <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">critical number</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;critical number\lt /main&gt;} at \(x = c\) provided that \(c\) is in the domain of \(f\), and \(f'(c) = 0\) or \(f'(c)\) is undefined. Critical numbers provide us with the only possible locations where the function \(f\) may have relative extremes. Note that not every critical number produces a maximum or minimum; in the middle graph of <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.extremes.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.extremes" alt="Figure 3.1.3 " title="Figure 3.1.3 ">FigureÂ 3.1.3</a>, the function pictured there has a horizontal tangent line at the noted point, but the function is increasing before and increasing after, so the critical number does not yield a location where the function is greater than every value nearby, nor less than every value nearby.
