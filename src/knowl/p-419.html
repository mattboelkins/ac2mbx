While some minor simplification is possible, we are content to leave \(s'(y)\) in its current form, having found the desired derivative of \(s\). In summary, to compute the derivative of \(s\), we applied the quotient rule. In so doing, when it was time to compute the derivative of the top function, we used the product rule; at the point where we found the derivative of the bottom function, we used the sum rule.
