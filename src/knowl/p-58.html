As \(x \to 0\), we observe that \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) does not behave in an elementary way. When \(x\) is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) increases without bound. When \(x\) is negative and approaching zero, \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to \(x = 0\), the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to wild oscillations in the graph of \(g\). It is an instructive exercise to plot the function \(g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)\) with a graphing utility and then zoom in on \(x = 0\). Doing so shows that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin and suggests that \(g\) does not have a limit at \(x = 0\).
