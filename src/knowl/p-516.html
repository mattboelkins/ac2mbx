In the process of getting comfortable with derivative rules, an excellent exercise is to write down a list of all basic functions whose derivatives are known, list those derivatives, and then write the corresponding chain rule for the composite version with the inner function being an unknown function \(u(x)\) and the outer function being the known basic function. These versions of the chain rule are particularly simple when the inner function is linear, since the derivative of a linear function is a constant. For instance,
