The biggest difference between the Trapezoid Rule and a left, right, or middle Riemann sum is that on each subinterval, the Trapezoid Rule uses two function values, rather than one, to estimate the (signed) area bounded by the curve. For instance, to compute \(D_1\), the area of the trapezoid generated by the curve \(y = f(x)\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_5.6.TRAP.html" knowl-id="xref-F_5.6.TRAP" alt="Figure 5.6.2 " title="Figure 5.6.2 ">FigureÂ 5.6.2</a> on \([x_0, x_1]\), we observe that the left base of this trapezoid has length \(f(x_0)\), while the right base has length \(f(x_1)\). In addition, the height of this trapezoid is \(x_1 - x_0 = \triangle x = \frac{b-a}{3}\). Since the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height, we have
