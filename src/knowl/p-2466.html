We have noted at several points in our work with Taylor polynomials and Taylor series that polynomial functions are the simplest possible functions in mathematics, in part because they essentially only require addition and multiplication to evaluate. Moreover, from the point of view of calculus, polynomials are especially nice: we can easily differentiate or integrate any polynomial. In light of our work in <a href="S_8.5.Taylor.html" alt="Section 8.5 Taylor Polynomials and Taylor Series" title="Section 8.5 Taylor Polynomials and Taylor Series">SectionÂ 8.5</a>, we now know that several important non-polynomials have polynomial-like expansions. For example, for any real number \(x\),
