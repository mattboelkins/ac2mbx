</h5>Note that it would be ideal if the value of the limit \(L\) was \(1\), for then \(f\) would be a particularly special function:  its derivative would be simply \(a^x\), which would mean that its derivative is itself.  By experimenting with different values of \(a\) between \(2\) and \(3\), try to find a value for \(a\) for which
