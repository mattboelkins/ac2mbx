This theorem validates the steps we took in <a knowl="./knowl/x8.6.Act3.html" knowl-id="xref-x8.6.Act3" alt="Exercise 8.6.7 " title="Exercise 8.6.7 ">ActivityÂ 8.6.7</a>. It is important to note that this result about differentiating and integrating power series tells us that we can differentiate and integrate term by term on the interior of the interval of convergence, but it does not tell us what happens at the endpoints of this interval. We always need to check what happens at the endpoints separately. More importantly, we can use use the approach of differentiating or integrating a series term by term to find new series.
