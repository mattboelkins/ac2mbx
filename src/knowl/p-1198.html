Here, using the first and second derivatives of \(E\), along with the fact that \(E(0) = 0\), we can determine more information about the behavior of \(E\). First, with \(E'(x) = e^{-x^2}\), we note that for all real numbers \(x\), \(e^{-x^2} &gt; 0\), and thus \(E'(x) &gt; 0\) for all \(x\). Thus \(E\) is an always increasing function. Further, we note that as \(x \to \infty\), \(E'(x) = e^{-x^2} \to 0\), hence the slope of the function \(E\) tends to zero as \(x \to \infty\) (and similarly as \(x \to -\infty\)). Indeed, it turns out (due to some more sophisticated analysis) that \(E\) has horizontal asymptotes as \(x\) increases or decreases without bound.
