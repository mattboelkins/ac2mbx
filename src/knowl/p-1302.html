Solution.    
Whenever we are trying to integrate a product of basic functions through Integration by Parts, we are presented with a choice for \(u\) and \(dv\). In the current problem, we can either let \(u = x\) and \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\), or let \(u = \cos(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\). While there is not a universal rule for how to choose \(u\) and \(dv\), a good guideline is this: do so in a way that \(\int v \, du\) is at least as simple as the original problem \(\int u \, dv\).
