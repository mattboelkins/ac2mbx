A computer algebra system (CAS) is a computer program that is capable of executing symbolic mathematics. For a simple example, if we ask a CAS to solve the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) for the variable \(x\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are arbitrary constants, the program will return \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). While research to develop the first CAS dates to the 1960s, these programs became more common and publicly available in the early 1990s. Two prominent early examples are the programs <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Maple</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Mathematica</em>, which were among the first computer algebra systems to offer a graphical user interface. Today, <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Maple</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Mathematica</em> are exceptionally powerful professional software packages that are capable of executing an amazing array of sophisticated mathematical computations. They are also very expensive, as each is a proprietary program. The CAS <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">SAGE</em> is an open-source, free alternative to <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Maple</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">Mathematica</em>.
