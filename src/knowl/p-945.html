It is apparent from several different problems we have considered that sums of areas of rectangles is one of the main ways to approximate the area under a curve over a given interval. Intuitively, we expect that using a larger number of thinner rectangles will provide a way to improve the estimates we are computing. As such, we anticipate dealing with sums with a large number of terms. To do so, we introduce the use of so-called <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">sigma notation</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;sigma notation\lt /main&gt;}, named for the Greek letter \(\Sigma\), which is the capital letter \(S\) in the Greek alphabet.
