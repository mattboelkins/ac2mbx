In Preview <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html#PA_1.2" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a>, you saw that for the given function \(g\), as \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, \(g(x)\) gets as close as we want to the value 4. At first, this may feel counterintuitive, because the value of \(g(0)\) is \(1\), not \(4\). By their very definition, limits regard the behavior of a function <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">arbitrarily close to</em> a fixed input, but the value of the function <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">at</em> the fixed input does not matter. More formally<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-1" id="fn-1"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-1" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.  To be completely precise, it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say “as close to \(L\) as we like” and “sufficiently close to \(a\).”  That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.  The definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.</span></span>, we say the following.
