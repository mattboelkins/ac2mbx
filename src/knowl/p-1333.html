in an effort to evaluate the original integral \(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\) by instead evaluating \(\int v \, du = \int f'(x) g(x) \, dx\).
\item When deciding to integrate by parts, we normally have a product of functions present in the integrand and we have to select both \(u\) and \(dv\). That selection is guided by the overall principal that we desire the new integral \(\int v \, du\) to not be any more difficult or complicated than the original integral \(\int u \, dv\). In addition, it is often helpful to recognize if one of the functions present is much easier to differentiate than antidifferentiate (such as \(\ln(x)\)), in which case that function often is best assigned the variable \(u\). For sure, when choosing \(dv\), the corresponding function must be one that we can antidifferentiate.
