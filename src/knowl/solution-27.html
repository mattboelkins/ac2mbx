<li id="li-737">By the sum and constant multiple rules, \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 3(-\sin(t)) - 4(\cos(t)) = -3\sin(t) - 4\cos(t)\).</li>
<li id="li-738">The exact slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x) = 2x + \frac{\sin(x)}{2}\) at \(x = \frac{\pi}{6}\) is given by \(f'(\frac{\pi}{6})\).  So, we first compute \(f'(x)\).  Using the sum and constant multiple rules, \(f'(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos(x)\), and thus \(f'(\frac{\pi}{6}) = 2 + \frac{1}{2} \cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) = 2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.\)</li>
<li id="li-739">The tangent line passes through the point \((\frac{\pi}{2}, g(\frac{\pi}{2}))\) with slope \(g'(\frac{\pi}{2})\).  We observe first that \(g(\frac{\pi}{2}) = (\frac{\pi}{2})^2 + 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \frac{\pi^2}{4}\).  Next, we compute the derivative function, \(g'(x)\), and find that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-84">\[
g'(x) = 2x - 2\sin(x).
\]</span>
 
	Thus, \(g(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \pi - 1\).
	
	Hence the equation of the tangent line (in point-slope form) is given by 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-85">\[
y - \frac{\pi^2}{4} = (\pi-1)(x-\frac{\pi}{2}).
\]</span>
</li>
<li id="li-740">Noting that \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{2})\) is a constant, we have \(p'(z) = 4z^3 + 4^z \ln(4) - 4\sin(z)\).</li>
<li id="li-741">The value of \(P'(2)\) will tell us the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) at the instant two decades have elapsed.  Observe that \(P'(t) = 8\cos(t)\), and thus \(P'(2) = 8\cos(2) \approx -3.329\) hundred animals per decade.  This tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) on January 1, 2030 is about \(-3329\) animals per decade, which tells us that the animal population is shrinking considerably at this point in time.  We might say that for whatever the population is on January 1, 2030, we expect that population to drop by about 3300 animals over the next ten years, provided the current population trend continues.</li>
