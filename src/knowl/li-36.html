</h5>Since \(AV_{[1.499,1.5]} = -15.984\) and \(AV_{[1.5, 1.501]} = -16.016\), it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 1.5\) is approximately \(-16\) ft/sec.  Similar computations show that at \(t = 2\), it appears the instantaneous velocity is about \(-32\) ft/sec.  Note that \(-16&gt;-32\), so the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 1.5\) is greater because it is “less negative.” Asking which number is “greater” is different from asking which number is “more negative.”</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.1.Velocity.html#li-36">in-context</a></span>
