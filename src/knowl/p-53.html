The situation is more complicated when \(x \to -2\), due in part to the fact that \(f(-2)\) is not defined. If we attempt to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator, we observe that as \(x \to -2\), \((4-x^2) \to (4 - (-2)^2) = 0\), and \((x+2) \to (-2 + 2) = 0\), so as \(x \to -2\), the numerator of \(f\) tends to 0 and the denominator tends to 0. We call \(0/0\) an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">indeterminate form</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;indeterminate\lt /main&gt;} and will revisit several important issues surrounding such quantities later in the course. For now, we simply observe that this tells us there is somehow more work to do. From the table and the graph, it appears that \(f\) should have a limit of \(4\) at \(x = -2\). To see algebraically why this is the case, let's work directly with the form of \(f(x)\). Observe that
