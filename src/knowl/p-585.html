Because a circle is perhaps the simplest of all curves that cannot be represented explicitly as a single function of \(x\), we begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle given by \(x^2 + y^2 = 16.\) It is visually apparent that this curve is locally linear, so it makes sense for us to want to find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point, and moreover to think that the curve is differentiable. The big question is: how do we find a formula for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), the slope of the tangent line to the circle at a given point on the circle? By viewing \(y\) as an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">implicit</em><span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-19" id="fn-19"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-19" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Essentially the idea of an implicit function is that it can be broken into pieces where each piece can be viewed as an explicit function of \(x\), and the combination of those pieces constitutes the full implicit function.

Just as \(y\) represents an unknown formula, so too its derivative with respect to \(x\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), will be (at least temporarily) unknown.
