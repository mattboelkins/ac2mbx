We note that all of the established meaning of the derivative function still holds, so when we compute \(y = f''(x)\), this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve \(y = f'(x)\), as well as the instantaneous rate of change of \(y = f'(x)\). In other words, just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes, the second derivative measures the rate at which the first derivative changes. This means that the second derivative tracks the instantaneous rate of change of the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\). That is, the second derivative will help us to understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.
