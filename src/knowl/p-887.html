In the very first section of the text, we considered a situation where a moving object had a known position at time \(t\). In particular, we stipulated that a tennis ball tossed into the air had its height \(s\) (in feet) at time \(t\) (in seconds) given by \(s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2\). From this starting point, we investigated the average velocity of the ball on a given interval \([a,b]\), computed by the difference quotient \(\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}\), and eventually found that we could determine the exact instantaneous velocity of the ball at time \(t\) by taking the derivative of the position function,
