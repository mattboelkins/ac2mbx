Whether driving a car, riding a bike, or throwing a ball, we have an intuitive sense that any moving object has a velocity at any given moment â€“ a number that measures how fast the object is moving <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">right now</em>. For instance, a car's speedometer tells the driver what appears to be the car's velocity at any given instant. In fact, the posted velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval (by computing how many revolutions the tires have undergone to compute distance traveled), since velocity fundamentally comes from considering a change in position divided by a change in time. But if we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter, then we can progress from average velocity to <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">instantaneous</em> velocity.
