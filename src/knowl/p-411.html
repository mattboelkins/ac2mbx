In general, we must be careful in doing any such simplification, as we don't want to correctly execute the quotient rule but then find an incorrect overall derivative due to an algebra error. As such, we will often place more emphasis on correctly using derivative rules than we will on simplifying the result that follows. The next activity further explores the use of the quotient rule.
