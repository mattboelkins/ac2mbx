\item The shape of the region usually dictates whether we should use vertical rectangles of thickness \(\triangle x\) or horizontal rectangles of thickness \(\triangle y\). We desire to have the height of the rectangle governed by the difference between two curves: if those curves are best thought of as functions of \(y\), we use horizontal rectangles, whereas if those curves are best viewed as functions of \(x\), we use vertical rectangles.
\item The arc length, \(L\), along the curve \(y = f(x)\) from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\) is given by
