Next, it is essential that we recognize the different roles being played by \(x\) and \(y\). Since \(x\) is the independent variable, it is the variable with respect to which we are differentiating, and thus \(\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x.\) But \(y\) is the dependent variable and \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\). Thus, when we want to compute \(\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]\) it is identical to the situation in Preview <a href="S_2.7.Implicit.html#PA_2.7" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> where we computed \(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]\). In both situations, we have an unknown function being squared, and we seek the derivative of the result. This requires the chain rule, by which we find that \(\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}.\) Therefore, continuing our work in differentiating both sides of \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\), we now have that
