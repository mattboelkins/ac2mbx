As we proceed to thinking about contexts other than just velocity and position, it is advantageous to have a shorthand symbol for a function's antiderivative. In the general setting of a continuous function \(f\), we will often denote an antiderivative of \(f\) by \(F\), so that the relationship between \(F\) and \(f\) is that \(F'(x) = f(x)\) for all relevant \(x\). Using the notation \(V\) in place of \(s\) (so that \(V\) is an antiderivative of \(v\)) in EquationÂ <a knowl="./knowl/E_FTCVel.html" knowl-id="xref-E_FTCVel" alt="Equation 4.4.1 " title="Equation 4.4.1 ">(4.4.1)</a>, we find it is equivalent to write that
