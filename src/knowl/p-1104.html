The Total Change Theorem tells us more about the relationship between the graph of a function and that of its derivative. Recall <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.4.ffprime.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.4.ffprime" alt="Figure 1.4.1 " title="Figure 1.4.1 ">FigureÂ 1.4.1</a>, which provided one of the first times we saw that heights on the graph of the derivative function come from slopes on the graph of the function itself. That observation occurred in the context where we knew \(f\) and were seeking \(f'\); if now instead we think about knowing \(f'\) and seeking information about \(f\), we can instead say the following:
