It is also helpful to recall, as we first experienced in <a href="S_1.3.DerivativePt.html" alt="Section 1.3 The derivative of a function at a point" title="Section 1.3 The derivative of a function at a point">SectionÂ 1.3</a>, that when we want to estimate the value of \(f'(x)\) at a given \(x\), we can use the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">difference quotient</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;difference quotient\lt /main&gt;} \(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\) with a relatively small value of \(h\). In doing so, we should use both positive and negative values of \(h\) in order to make sure we account for the behavior of the function on both sides of the point of interest. To that end, we consider the following brief example to demonstrate the notion of a <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">central difference</em> and its role in estimating derivatives.
