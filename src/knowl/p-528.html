As we have noted, one of the most important functions in all of mathematics is the natural exponential function \(f(x) = e^x\). Because the natural logarithm, \(g(x) = \ln(x)\), is the inverse of the natural exponential function, the natural logarithm is similarly important. One of our goals in this section is to learn how to differentiate the logarithm function, and thus expand our library of basic functions with known derivative formulas. First, we investigate a more familiar setting to refresh some of the basic concepts surrounding functions and their inverses.
