<span class="footnote"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Footnote</span> <span class="codenumber">1.2.1</span></span>What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.  To be completely precise, it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say “as close to \(L\) as we like” and “sufficiently close to \(a\).”  That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.  The definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.2.Limits.html#fn-1">in-context</a></span>
