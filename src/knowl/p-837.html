We are next going to consider situations where multiple quantities are related to one another and changing, but where each quantity can be considered an implicit function of the variable \(t\), which represents time. Through knowing how the quantities are related, we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related. For example, suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon in such a way that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. It makes sense that since the balloon's volume and radius are related, by knowing how fast the volume is changing, we ought to be able to relate this rate to how fast the radius is changing. More specifically, can we find how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?
