</h5>A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well.  When lifted from the water, the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds.  As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate, the bucket leaks water at a constant rate so that it is losing weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot.  What function \(B(h)\) tells the weight of the bucket after the bucket has been lifted \(h\) feet?  What is the total amount of work accomplished in lifting the bucket to the top of the well?</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_6.4.Physics.html#li-2362">in-context</a></span>
