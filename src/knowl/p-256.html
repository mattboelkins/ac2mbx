We recall that a function \(f\) is said to be differentiable at \(x = a\) whenever \(f'(a)\) exists. Moreover, for \(f'(a)\) to exist, we know that the function \(y = f(x)\) must have a tangent line at the point \((a,f(a))\), since \(f'(a)\) is precisely the slope of this line. In order to even ask if \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\), it is necessary that \(f\) be continuous at \(x = a\): if \(f\) fails to have a limit at \(x = a\), if \(f(a)\) is not defined, or if \(f(a)\) does not equal the value of \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\), then it doesn't even make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.
