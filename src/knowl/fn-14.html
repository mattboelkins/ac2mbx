<span class="footnote"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Footnote</span> <span class="codenumber">2.3.1</span></span>While this example highlights why the product rule is true, there are some subtle issues to recognize.  For one, if the stock's value really does rise exactly $0.75 on day 100, and the number of shares really rises by 12 on day 100, then we'd expect that \(V(101) = N(101) \cdot S(101) = 532 \cdot 28.25 = 15029\).  If, as noted above, we expect the total value to rise by $720, then with \(V(100) = N(100) \cdot S(100) = 520 \cdot 27.50 = 14300\), then it seems like we should find that \(V(101) = V(100) + 720 = 15020.\)  Why do the two results differ by 9?  One way to understand why this difference occurs is to recognize that \(N'(100) = 12\) represents an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">instantaneous</em> rate of change, while our (informal) discussion has also thought of this number as the total change in the number of shares over the course of a single day.  The formal proof of the product rule reconciles this issue by taking the limit as the change in the input tends to zero.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2.3.ProdQuot.html#fn-14">in-context</a></span>
