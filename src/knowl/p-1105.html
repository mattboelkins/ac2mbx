To see why this is so, say we consider the difference \(f(1) - f(0)\). Note that this value is 3, in part because \(f(1) = 3\) and \(f(0) = 0\), but also because the net signed area bounded by \(y = f'(x)\) on \([0,1]\) is 3. That is, \(f(1) - f(0) = \int_0^1 f'(x) \, dx\). A similar pattern holds throughout, including the fact that since the total net signed area bounded by \(f'\) on \([0,4]\) is \(0\), \(\int_0^4 f'(x) \, dx = 0\), so it must be that \(f(4) - f(0) = 0\), so \(f(4) = f(0)\).
