In particular, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_4.3.Sum.html" knowl-id="xref-F_4.3.Sum" alt="Figure 4.3.11 " title="Figure 4.3.11 ">FigureÂ 4.3.11</a>, if we take the sum of two functions \(f\) and \(g\), at every point in the interval, the height of the function \(f+g\) is given by \((f+g)(x_i) = f(x_i) + g(x_i)\), which is the sum of the individual function values of \(f\) and \(g\) (taken at left endpoints). Hence, for the pictured rectangles with areas \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), it follows that \(C = A + B\), and because this will occur for every such rectangle, in the limit the area of the gray region will be the sum of the areas of the blue and red regions. Stated in terms of definite integrals, we have the following general rule.
