An essential observation about our work in <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_5.3.usub.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_5.3.usub" alt="Example 5.3.2 " title="Example 5.3.2 ">ExampleÂ 5.3.2</a> is that the \(u\)-substitution only worked because the function multiplying \(\sin (7x^4 + 3)\) was \(x^3\). If instead that function was \(x^2\) or \(x^4\), the substitution process may not (and likely would not) have worked. This is one of the primary challenges of antidifferentiation: slight changes in the integrand make tremendous differences. For instance, we can use \(u\)-substitution with \(u = x^2\) and \(du = 2xdx\) to find that
