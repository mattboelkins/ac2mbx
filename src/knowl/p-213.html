A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature \(F\) (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time \(t\) is measured in minutes. In <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.5.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.5.1" alt="Exercise 1.5.4 " title="Exercise 1.5.4 ">ActivityÂ 1.5.4</a>, we computed approximations to \(F'(30)\) and \(F'(60)\) using central differences. Those values and more are provided in the second table below, along with several others computed in the same way.
