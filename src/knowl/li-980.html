</h5>Now suppose that the height of water in the tank is being regulated by an inflow and outflow (e.g., a faucet and a drain) so that the height of the water at time \(t\) is given by the rule \(h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1\), where \(t\) is measured in hours (and \(h\) is still measured in feet).  At what rate is the height of the water changing with respect to time at the instant \(t = 2\)?</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2.5.Chain.html#li-980">in-context</a></span>
