Graphing the region between the two curves in the first quadrant between their points of intersection (\((0,0)\) and \((1,1)\)) and then revolving the region about the line \(y = -1\), we see the solid shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_6.2.Ex4.html" knowl-id="xref-F_6.2.Ex4" alt="Figure 6.2.12 " title="Figure 6.2.12 ">FigureÂ 6.2.12</a>. Each slice of the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution is a washer, and the radii of each washer are governed by the curves \(y = x^2\) and \(y = x\). But we also see that there is one added change: the axis of revolution adds a fixed length to each radius. In particular, the inner radius of a typical slice, \(r(x)\), is given by \(r(x) = x^2 + 1\), while the outer radius is \(R(x) = x+1\). Therefore, the volume of a typical slice is
