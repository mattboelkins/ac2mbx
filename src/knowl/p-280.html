which we can also express as \(y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)\). Note well: there is a major difference between \(f(a)\) and \(f(x)\) in this context. The former is a constant that results from using the given fixed value of \(a\), while the latter is the general expression for the rule that defines the function. The same is true for \(f'(a)\) and \(f'(x)\): we must carefully distinguish between these expressions. Each time we find the tangent line, we need to evaluate the function and its derivative at a fixed \(a\)-value.
