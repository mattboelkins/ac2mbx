Early on in our work with the definite integral, we learned that if we have a nonnegative velocity function, \(v\), for an object moving along an axis, the area under the velocity function between \(a\) and \(b\) tells us the distance the object traveled on that time interval. Moreover, based on the definition of the definite integral, that area is given precisely by \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\). Indeed, for any nonnegative function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\), we know that \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) measures the area bounded by the curve and the \(x\)-axis between \(x = a\) and \(x = b\).
