An idea that sits at the foundations of calculus is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">instantaneous rate of change</em> of a function. This rate of change is always considered with respect to change in the input variable, often at a particular fixed input value. This is a generalization of the notion of instantaneous velocity and essentially allows us to consider the question “how do we measure how fast a particular function is changing at a given point?” When the original function represents the position of a moving object, this instantaneous rate of change is precisely velocity, and might be measured in units such as feet per second. But in other contexts, instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day, the number of additional gallons of gasoline consumed by going one mile per additional mile per hour in a car's velocity, or the number of dollars added to a mortgage payment for each percentage increase in interest rate. Regardless of the presence of a physical or practical interpretation of a function, the instantaneous rate of change may also be interpreted geometrically in connection to the function's graph, and this connection is also foundational to many of the main ideas in calculus.
