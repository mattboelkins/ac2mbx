</h5>Since a line is vertical whenever its slope is undefined, we seek all points \((x,y)\) that make \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) undefined.  This will occur precisely when the denominator, \(5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4\), is zero.  Using a graphing utility or computer algebra system to solve the equation \(5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4 = 0\), we find that this happens at the four approximate \(y\)-values \(y \approx \pm 0.543912, \pm 1.64443\).  For each such value, we use the original equation \(x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y\) to find the \(x\)-value of the point.  Doing so, we have established that there are four points at which the tangent line is vertical, and they are approximately \((1.418697,0.543912)\), \((-1.418697,-0.543912)\), \((-3.63143, 1.64443)\), and \((3.63143, -1.64443)\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2.7.Implicit.html#li-1099">in-context</a></span>
