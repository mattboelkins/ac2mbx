say the exact same thing. We often read “the arcsine of \(y\)” as “the angle whose sine is \(y\).” For example, we say that \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) is the angle whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\), which can be written more concisely as \(\arcsin(\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\pi}{6}\), which is equivalent to writing \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}.\)
