The last stated fact reveals a special relationship between the graphs of \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\). In particular, if we consider \(y = f(x)\) and a point \((x,y)\) that lies on the graph of \(f\), then it is also true that \(x = f^{-1}(y)\), which means that the point \((y,x)\) lies on the graph of \(f^{-1}\). This shows us that the graphs of \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) are the reflections of one another across the line \(y = x\), since reflecting across \(y = x\) is precisely the geometric action that swaps the coordinates in an ordered pair. In <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.6.InversePlot.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.6.InversePlot" alt="Figure 2.6.1 " title="Figure 2.6.1 ">FigureÂ 2.6.1</a>, we see this exemplified for the function \(y = f(x) = 2^x\) and its inverse, with the points \((-1,\frac{1}{2})\) and \((\frac{1}{2},-1)\) highlighting the reflection of the curves across \(y = x\).
