For the sump crock described in this example, each slice of water is cylindrical in shape. We see that the radius of each approximately cylindrical slice varies according to the linear function \(y = f(x)\) that passes through the points \((0,1.5)\) and \((4,0.75)\), where \(x\) is the depth of the particular slice in the tank; it is a straightforward exercise to find that \(f(x) = 1.5 - 0.375x\). Now we are prepared to think about the overall problem in several steps: (a) determining the volume of a typical slice; (b) finding the weight<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-44" id="fn-44"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 2 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-44" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">We assume that the weight density of water  is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot.</span></span> of a typical slice (and thus the force that must be exerted on it); (c) deciding the distance that a typical slice moves; and (d) computing the work to move a representative slice. Once we know the work it takes to move one slice, we use a definite integral over an appropriate interval to find the total work.
