In addition to our usual \(f'\) notation for the derivative, there are other ways to symbolically denote the derivative of a function, as well as the instruction to take the derivative. We know that if we have a function, say \(f(x) = x^2\), that we can denote its derivative by \(f'(x)\), and we write \(f'(x) = 2x\). Equivalently, if we are thinking more about the relationship between \(y\) and \(x\), we sometimes denote the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) with the symbol
