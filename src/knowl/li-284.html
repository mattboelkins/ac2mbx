</h5>Throughout the time interval \([0,90]\), the temperature \(F\) of the potato is increasing.  But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing.  That is, while the values of \(F\) continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of \(F'\) are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that “the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.”</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.5.Units.html#li-284">in-context</a></span>
