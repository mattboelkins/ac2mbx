As has been and will continue to be the case throughout our work in <a href="C_2.html" alt="Chapter 2 Computing Derivatives" title="Chapter 2 Computing Derivatives">ChapterÂ 2</a>, the derivative retains all of its fundamental meaning as an instantaneous rate of change and as the slope of the tangent line to the function under consideration. Our present work primarily expands the list of functions for which we can quickly determine a formula for the derivative. Moreover, with the addition of \(\tan(x)\), \(\cot(x)\), \(\sec(x)\), and \(\csc(x)\) to our library of basic functions, there are many more functions we can differentiate through the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules.
