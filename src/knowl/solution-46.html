<li id="li-1218">Since \(\ds g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\), we see that \(g'(x) = 0\) implies that \(x = -4\) or \(x = 1\).  While \(x = 2\) makes \(g'\) undefined, we are told that \(g\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\), so \(x = 2\) is not in the domain of \(g\), and hence is technically not a critical value of \(g\).  Nonetheless, we place \(x = 2\) on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which \(g'\) may change sign.</li>
<li id="li-1219">The first derivative sign chart shows that \(g'(x) &gt; 0\) for \(x \lt  -4\), \(g'(x) \lt  0\) for \(-4 \lt  x \lt  1\), \(g'(x) \lt  0\) for \(1 \lt  x \lt  2\), and \(g'(x) &gt; 0\) for \(x &gt; 2\).  By the first derivative test, \(g\) has a local maximum at \(x = -4\) and neither a max nor min at \(x = 1\).  As these are the only two critical values, these are the only two locations for possible extremes.  (Note: although \(g\) changes from decreasing to increasing at \(x = 2\), this is due to a vertical asymptote, and \(g\) does not have a minimum there.)</li>
<li id="li-1220">Because \(g\) is decreasing as \(x \to 2^-\) (where \(g\) has a vertical asymptote), \(g\) does not have a global minimum.  For \(x &gt; 2\), \(g\) is always increasing, which suggests that \(g\) does not have a global maximum (though we do not know for sure that \(g\) increases without bound).</li>
<li id="li-1221">We observe that
  
<span class="displaymath" id="md-34">\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} g'(x) \amp  = \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\\
\amp  = \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 4}{x-2} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}}\\
\amp  = \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + 2x - 7 + \frac{4}{x}}{1 - \frac{2}{x}}\\
\amp  = \amp  \infty
\end{align*}</span>
 
Since \(g'(x) \to \infty\) as \(x \to \infty\), this tells us that \(g\) increases without bound as \(x \to \infty\).</li>
<li id="li-1222">From all of our work above, we know that \(g\) has a local maximum at \(x = -4\), a horizontal tangent line with neither a max nor min at \(x = 1\), and a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\), plus \(g\) and \(g'\) both increase without bound as \(x \to \infty\).  Thus, a possible graph of \(g\) is the following.
