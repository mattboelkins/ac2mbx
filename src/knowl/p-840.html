In problems where two or more quantities can be related to one another, and all of the variables involved can be viewed as implicit functions of time, \(t\), we are often interested in how the rates of change of the individual quantities with respect to time are themselves related; we call these <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">related rates</em> problems.\knownindex{\lt main&gt;related rates\lt /main&gt;} Often these problems involve identifying one or more key underlying geometric relationships to relate the variables involved. Once we have an equation establishing the fundamental relationship among variables, we differentiate implicitly with respect to time to find connections among the rates of change.
