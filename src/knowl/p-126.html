In your work in Preview <a href="S_1.4.DerivativeFxn.html#PA_1.4" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> with \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\), you may have found several patterns. One comes from observing that \(f'(0) = 4\), \(f'(1) = 2\), \(f'(2) = 0\), and \(f'(3) = -2\). That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that \(f'(4) = -4\) and \(f'(5) = -6.\) Even more than these individual numbers, if we consider the role of \(0\), \(1\), \(2\), and \(3\) in the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition, we observe that the particular number has very little effect on our work. To see this more clearly, we compute \(f'(a)\), where \(a\) represents a number to be named later. Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative,
