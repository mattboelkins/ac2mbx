</h5>Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius \(r\) is \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\).  Note well that in the setting of this problem, <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">both</em>\(V\) and \(r\) are changing as time \(t\) changes, and thus both \(V\) and \(r\) may be viewed as implicit functions of \(t\), with respective derivatives \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\).  
	
	Differentiate both sides of the equation \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\) with respect to \(t\) (using the chain rule on the right) to find a formula for \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) that depends on both \(r\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.5.RelatedRates.html#li-1482">in-context</a></span>
