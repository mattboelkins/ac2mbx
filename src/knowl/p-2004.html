\item A sequence is a list of objects in a specified order. We will typically work with sequences of real numbers and can also think of a sequence as a function from the positive integers to the set of real numbers.
\item A sequence \(\{s_n\}\) of real numbers converges to a number \(L\) if we can make every value of \(s_k\) for \(k \ge n\) as close as we want to \(L\) by choosing \(n\) sufficiently large.
\item A sequence diverges if it does not converge.
