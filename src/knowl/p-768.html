For the functions in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.3.Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.3.Intro" alt="Figure 3.3.1 " title="Figure 3.3.1 ">Figure 3.3.1</a> and Preview <a href="S_3.3.Optimization.html#PA_3.3" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a>, we were interested in finding the global minimum and global maximum on the entire domain, which turned out to be \((-\infty, \infty)\) for each. At other times, our perspective on a function might be more focused due to some restriction on its domain. For example, rather than considering \(f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\) for every value of \(x\), perhaps instead we are only interested in those \(x\) for which \(0 \le x \le 4\), and we would like to know which values of \(x\) in the interval \([0,4]\) produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of \(f\). We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function; now, by restricting the domain to an interval, it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider, as we see in the following activity. When limiting ourselves to a particular interval, we will often refer to the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">absolute</em> maximum or minimum value, rather than the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">global</em> maximum or minimum.
