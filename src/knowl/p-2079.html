We are charged interest every month at an annual rate of \(r\)%, so each month we pay \(\frac{r}{12}\)% interest on the principal that remains. Given that the original principal is \(P\) dollars, we will pay \(\left(\frac{0.0r}{12}\right)P\) dollars in interest on our first payment. Since we paid \(M\) dollars in total for our first payment, the remainder of the payment (\(M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P\)) goes to pay down the principal. So the principal remaining after the first payment (let's call it \(P_1\)) is the original principal minus what we paid on the principal, or
