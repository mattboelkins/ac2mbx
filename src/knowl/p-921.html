assigning the “\(-2\)” to the area in the interval \([1.5,2]\) because there velocity is negative and the person is walking in the “negative” direction. In other words, the person walks 4.5 miles in the positive direction, followed by two miles in the negative direction, and then 3 more miles in the positive direction. This affect of velocity being negative is also seen in the graph of the function \(y=s(t)\), which has a negative slope (specifically, its slope is \(-4\)) on the interval \(1.5\lt t\lt 2\) since the velocity is \(-4\) on that interval, which shows the person's position function is decreasing due to the fact that she is walking east, rather than west. On the intervals where she is walking west, the velocity function is positive and the slope of the position function \(s\) is therefore also positive.
