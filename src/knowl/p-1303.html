In this setting, this leads us to choose<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-36" id="fn-36"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-36" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Observe that if we considered the alternate choice, and let \(u = \cos(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\), then \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\) and \(v = \frac{1}{2}x^2\), from which we would write

Thus we have replaced the problem of integrating \(x \cos(x)\) with that of integrating \(\frac{1}{2}x^2 \sin(x)\); the latter is clearly more complicated, which shows that this alternate choice is not as helpful as the first choice.</span></span> \(u = x\) and \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\), from which it follows that \(du = 1 \, dx\) and \(v = \sin(x)\). With this substitution, the rule for Integration by Parts tells us that
