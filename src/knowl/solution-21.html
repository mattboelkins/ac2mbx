<li id="li-553">Since \(f(2) = -1\) and \(f'(2) = 2\), we have \(L(x) = -1 + 2(x-2)\).</li>
<li id="li-554">Using our work in (a), \(f(2.07) \approx L(2.07) = -1 + 2(2.07-2) = -1 + 2\cdot 0.07 = -0.86\).</li>
<li id="li-555">See the plot below.</li>
<li id="li-556">Is the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is increasing for \(x \lt  2\) because \(y = f'(x)\) is an increasing function on this interval.  Similarly, for \(x &gt; 2\), the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is decreasing.  Right at \(x = 2\), the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is neither increasing nor decreasing.</li>
<li id="li-557">See the plot below.  Note that \(y = f(x)\) is concave up for \(x \lt  2\) since \(f'\) is increasing on that interval, and \(y = f(x)\) is concave down for \(x &gt; 2\) since \(f'\) is decreasing there.  Hence \(y = f(x)\) changes from concave up to concave down right at \(x = 2\), which is also the point near 2 where the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is steepest.</li>
<li id="li-558">Because the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) lies above the graph  of \(f\) to the right of \(x = 2\), our estimate of \(f(2.07)\) is too large â€“ the local linearization overshoots the true value of \(f\) at this point.</li>
