\item If we consider the graph of an exponential function \(f(x) = a^x\) (where \(a &gt; 1\)), the graph of \(f'(x)\) behaves similarly, appearing exponential and as a possibly scaled version of the original function \(a^x\). For \(f(x) = 2^x\), careful analysis of the graph and its slopes suggests that \(\frac{d}{dx}[2^x] = 2^x \ln(2)\), which is a special case of the rule we stated in <a href="S_2.1.ElemRules.html" alt="Section 2.1 Elementary derivative rules" title="Section 2.1 Elementary derivative rules">SectionÂ 2.1</a>.
\item By carefully analyzing the graphs of \(y = \sin(x)\) and \(y = \cos(x)\), plus using the limit definition of the derivative at select points, we found that \(\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)] = \cos(x)\) and \(\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)\).
\item We note that all previously encountered derivative rules still hold, but now may also be applied to functions involving the sine and cosine, plus all of the established meaning of the derivative applies to these trigonometric functions as well.
