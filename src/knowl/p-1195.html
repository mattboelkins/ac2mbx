Solution.    
\(E\) is closely related to the well known <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">error function</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;error functin\lt /main&gt;}<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-32" id="fn-32"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 1 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-32" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The error function is defined by the rule \(\mbox{erf} (x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \,dt\) and has the key property that \(0 \le \mbox{erf} (x) \lt  1\) for all \(x \ge 0\) and moreover that \(\ds \lim_{x \to \infty} \mbox{erf} (x) = 1\).</span></span>, a function that is particularly important in probability and statistics. It turns out that the function \(e^{-t^2}\) does not have an elementary antiderivative that we can express without integrals. That is, whereas a function such as \(f(t) = 4-2t\) has elementary antiderivative \(F(t) = 4t - t^2\), we are unable to find a simple formula for an antiderivative of \(e^{-t^2}\) that does not involve a definite integral. We will learn more about finding (complicated) algebraic formulas for antiderivatives without definite integrals in the chapter on infinite series.
