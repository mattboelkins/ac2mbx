The context of position, velocity, and acceleration is an excellent one in which to understand how a function, its first derivative, and its second derivative are related to one another. In <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.6.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.6.1" alt="Exercise 1.6.10 " title="Exercise 1.6.10 ">ActivityÂ 1.6.10</a>, we can replace \(s\), \(v\), and \(a\) with an arbitrary function \(f\) and its derivatives \(f'\) and \(f''\), and essentially all the same observations hold. In particular, note that \(f'\) is increasing if and only if both \(f\) is concave up, and similarly \(f'\) is increasing if and only if \(f''\) is positive. Likewise, \(f'\) is decreasing if and only if both \(f\) is concave down, and \(f'\) is decreasing if and only if \(f''\) is negative.
