In addition to being able to find instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time, we are often able to make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time. For instance, when a conical tank (point down) is filling with water at a constant rate, we naturally intuit that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time. Note how carefully we need to speak: we mean to say that while the depth, \(h\), of the water is increasing, its rate of change \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is decreasing (both as a function of \(t\) and as a function of \(h\)). These observations may often be made by taking the general equation that relates the various rates and solving for one of them, and doing this without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates. For instance, in the conical tank problem in <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.5.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.5.1" alt="Exercise 3.5.2 " title="Exercise 3.5.2 ">ActivityÂ 3.5.2</a>, we established that
