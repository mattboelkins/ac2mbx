As we saw in the example provided by <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.8.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.8.1" alt="Exercise 1.8.3 " title="Exercise 1.8.3 ">ActivityÂ 1.8.3</a>, the local linearization \(y = L(x)\) is a linear function that shares two important values with the function \(y = f(x)\) that it is derived from. In particular, observe that since \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\), it follows that \(L(a) = f(a)\). In addition, since \(L\) is a linear function, its derivative is its slope. Hence, \(L'(x) = f'(a)\) for every value of \(x\), and specifically \(L'(a) = f'(a)\). Therefore, we see that \(L\) is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function \(f\) at the point \((a,f(a))\).
