</h5>It makes sense intuitively that there must be at least one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate at which calories are burned, as it would be impossible for a continuous instantaneous rate of change to always be above its average value.  Since we know from (c) that \(c_{\mbox{\tiny{AVG}} [0,30]} = \frac{125}{9}\), and \(c(t)\) tells us the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned, it follows that we want to solve the equation

c(t) = \frac{125}{9}.
\]</span>
 
From the graph, it appears that there are two such values of \(t\) for which this equation is true, one in the first ten minutes, and one in the last ten.  For instance, solving

<span class="displaymath" id="me-485">\[
-0.05t^2 + t + 10 = \frac{125}{9},
\]</span>
 
it follows that \(t = 10 \pm 10\sqrt{2}/3 \approx 14.714, 5.286\), only the second of which lies in \(0 \le t \le 10\).  So one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate on \([0,30]\) is \(t = 10 - 10\sqrt{2}/3 \approx 5.286.\)  Similar reasoning shows that the other time is \(t = 20 + 10\sqrt{2}/3 \approx 24.714\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_4.4.FTC.html#li-1859">in-context</a></span>
