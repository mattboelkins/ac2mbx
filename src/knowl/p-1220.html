\item When an aircraft attempts to climb as rapidly as
possible, its climb rate (in feet per minute) decreases as altitude
increases, because the air is less dense at higher altitudes.
Given below is a table showing performance data for a certain
single engine aircraft, giving its climb rate at various altitudes, where \(c(h)\) denotes the climb rate of the airplane at an altitude \(h\).
