Because work is calculated by the rule \(W = F \cdot d\), whenever the force \(F\) is constant, it follows that we can use a definite integral to compute the work accomplished by a varying force. For example, suppose that in a setting similar to the problem posed in Preview <a href="S_6.4.Physics.html#PA_6.4" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a>, we have a bucket being lifted in a 50-foot well whose weight at height \(h\) is given by \(B(h) = 12 + 8e^{-0.1h}\).
