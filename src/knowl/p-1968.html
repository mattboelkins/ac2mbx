The logistic equation is useful in other situations, too, as it is good for modeling any situation in which limited growth is possible. For instance, it could model the spread of a flu virus through a population contained on a cruise ship, the rate at which a rumor spreads within a small town, or the behavior of an animal population on an island. Again, it is important to realize that through our work in this section, we have completely solved the logistic equation, regardless of the values of the constants \(N\), \(k\), and \(P_0\). Anytime we encounter a logistic equation, we can apply the formula we found in EquationÂ <a knowl="./knowl/E_7.6.logistic_solution.html" knowl-id="xref-E_7.6.logistic_solution" alt="Equation 7.6.2 " title="Equation 7.6.2 ">(7.6.2)</a>.
