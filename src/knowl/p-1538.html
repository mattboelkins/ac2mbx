Now, it is particularly important to note that the thickness of a representative slice is \(\triangle y\), and that the slices are only cylindrical washers in nature when taken perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis. Hence, we envision slicing the solid horizontally, starting at \(y = 0\) and proceeding up to \(y = 1\). Because the inner radius is governed by the curve \(y = \sqrt{x}\), but from the perspective that \(x\) is a function of \(y\), we solve for \(x\) and get \(x = y^2 = r(y)\). In the same way, we need to view the curve \(y = x^4\) (which governs the outer radius) in the form where \(x\) is a function of \(y\), and hence \(x = \sqrt[4]{y}\). Therefore, we see that the volume of a typical slice is
