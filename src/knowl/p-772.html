The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that provided a function is continuous, on any closed interval \([a,b]\) the function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum. Note, however, that this result does not tell us where these extreme values occur, but rather only that they must exist. As seen in the examples of <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.3.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.3.1" alt="Exercise 3.3.2 " title="Exercise 3.3.2 ">ActivityÂ 3.3.2</a>, it is apparent that the only possible locations for relative extremes are either the endpoints of the interval or at a critical number (the latter being where a relative minimum or maximum could occur, which is a potential location for an absolute extreme). Thus, we have the following approach to finding the absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\):
