<li id="li-1554">The given information leads us to construct the following diagram:
	<img width="100%" src="images/3_5_Act3Soln.png">
</li>
<li id="li-1555">The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, with legs of length \(6\) and \(s\) is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs (length 15) and horizontal leg of length \(x + s\).  Because the ratios of the lengths of the legs of these two triangles is equal, we have
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-378">\[
\frac{s}{6} = \frac{s+x}{15}.
\]</span>
   
	Simplifying, we have \(15s = 6s + 6x\), so that \(9s = 2x\), or most simply, \(3s = 2x\).</li>
<li id="li-1556">Differentiating with respect to \(t\), it is immediate that \(3 \frac{ds}{dt} = 2\frac{dx}{dt}\).</li>
<li id="li-1557">Since \(\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{dx}{dt}\), and \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\), it follows \(\frac{ds}{dt} = 2\) for every value of \(t\) (and \(x\)).  Thus, \(\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8} = 2\) feet per second.</li>
<li id="li-1558">Because \(\frac{ds}{dt}\) is constant, the shadow's length is increasing at a constant rate (irrespective of the distance from the skateboarder to the lamppost).</li>
<li id="li-1559">Let \(y\) represent the location of the tip of the shadow, so that \(y = x + s\).  Observe that we can now compute \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) in terms of \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{ds}{dt}\), with \(\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 3 + 2 = 5\) feet/sec, and hence the tip of the shadow is moving more rapidly than the skateboarder himself.</li>
