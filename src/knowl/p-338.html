Say we have a function \(y = f(x)\) whose derivative formula is known. How is the derivative of \(y = kf(x)\) related to the derivative of the original function? Recall that when we multiply a function by a constant \(k\), we vertically stretch the graph by a factor of \(|k|\) (and reflect the graph across \(y = 0\) if \(k \lt  0\)). This vertical stretch affects the slope of the graph, making the slope of the function \(y = kf(x)\) be \(k\) times as steep as the slope of \(y = f(x)\). In terms of the derivative, this is essentially saying that when we multiply a function by a factor of \(k\), we change the value of its derivative by a factor of \(k\) as well.
