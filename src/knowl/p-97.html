As we will see in subsequent study, the existence of the tangent line at \(x = a\) is connected to whether or not the function \(f\) looks like a straight line when viewed up close at \((a,f(a))\), which can also be seen in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.3.SeqToTan.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.3.SeqToTan" alt="Figure 1.3.5 " title="Figure 1.3.5 ">Figure 1.3.5</a>, where we combine the four graphs in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.3.SeqToTanSeq.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.3.SeqToTanSeq" alt="Figure 1.3.4 " title="Figure 1.3.4 ">Figure 1.3.4</a> into the single one on the left, and then we zoom in on the box centered at \((a,f(a))\), with that view expanded on the right (with two of the secant lines omitted). Note how the tangent line sits relative to the curve \(y = f(x)\) at \((a,f(a))\) and how closely it resembles the curve near \(x = a\).
