Using computational technology, we find that 0.6881721793 is the sum of the first 100 terms in this series. As a comparison, \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931471806\). This shows that even though the series <a knowl="./knowl/eq_ln_2.html" knowl-id="xref-eq_ln_2" alt="Equation 8.4.1 " title="Equation 8.4.1 ">(8.4.1)</a> converges to \(\ln(2)\), it must do so quite slowly, since the sum of the first 100 terms isn't particularly close to \(\ln(2)\). We will investigate the issue of how quickly an alternating series converges later in this section. Again, note particularly that the series <a knowl="./knowl/eq_ln_2.html" knowl-id="xref-eq_ln_2" alt="Equation 8.4.1 " title="Equation 8.4.1 ">(8.4.1)</a> is different from the series we have consider earlier in that some of the terms are negative. We call such a series an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">alternating series</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;alternating series\lt /main&gt;}.
