We have seen that the Second FTC enables us to construct an antiderivative \(F\) of any continuous function \(f\) by defining \(F\) by the corresponding integral function \(F(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\). Said differently, if we have a function of the form \(F(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\), then we know that \(F'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left[\int_c^x f(t) \, dt \right] = f(x)\). This shows that integral functions, while perhaps having the most complicated formulas of any functions we have encountered, are nonetheless particularly simple to differentiate. For instance, if
