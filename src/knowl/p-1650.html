At any point on this slice, the depth is approximately constant, and thus the pressure can be considered constant. In particular, we note that since \(x\) measures the distance to the top of the dam, and because the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, the depth of any point on the representative slice is approximately \((x-5)\). Now, since pressure is given by \(P = 62.4d\), we have that at any point on the representative slice
