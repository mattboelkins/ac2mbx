A bucket is being lifted from the bottom of a 50-foot deep well; its weight (including the water), \(B\), in pounds at a height \(h\) feet above the water is given by the function \(B(h)\). When the bucket leaves the water, the bucket and water together weigh \(B(0) = 20\) pounds, and when the bucket reaches the top of the well, \(B(50) = 12\) pounds. Assume that the bucket loses water at a constant rate (as a function of height, \(h\)) throughout its journey from the bottom to the top of the well.
