As we close this section, it is important to note that both integration techniques we have discussed apply in relatively limited circumstances. In particular, it is not hard to find examples of functions for which neither technique produces an antiderivative; indeed, there are many, many functions that appear elementary but that do not have an elementary algebraic antiderivative. For instance, if we consider the indefinite integrals
