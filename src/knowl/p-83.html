In what follows, we will introduce terminology and notation that makes it easier to talk about the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point. In addition, just as instantaneous velocity is defined in terms of average velocity, the more general instantaneous rate of change will be connected to the more general average rate of change. Recall that for a moving object with position function \(s\), its average velocity on the time interval \(t = a\) to \(t = a+h\) is given by the quotient
