For now, it is most important to observe that if we are given a formula for a velocity function \(v\), it can be very helpful to find a function \(s\) that satisfies \(s' = v\). In this context, we say that \(s\) is an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">antiderivative</em> of \(v\). More generally, just as we say that \(f'\) is the derivative of \(f\) for a given function \(f\), if we are given a function \(g\) and \(G\) is a function such that \(G' = g\), we say that \(G\) is an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">antiderivative</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;antiderivative\lt /main&gt;} of \(g\). For example, if \(g(x) = 3x^2 + 2x\), an antiderivative of \(g\) is \(G(x) = x^3 + x^2\), since \(G'(x) = g(x)\). Note that we say “an” antiderivative of \(g\) rather than “the” antiderivative of \(g\) because \(H(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 5\) is also a function whose derivative is \(g\), and thus \(H\) is another antiderivative of \(g\).
