To help better understand the relationship among changes in \(N\), \(S\), and \(V\), let's consider some specific data. Suppose that on day 100, the investor owns 520 shares of stock and the stock's current value is $27.50 per share. This tells us that \(N(100) = 520\) and \(S(100) = 27.50\). In addition, say that on day 100, the investor purchases an additional 12 shares (so the number of shares held is rising at a rate of 12 shares per day), and that on that same day the price of the stock is rising at a rate of 0.75 dollars per share per day. Viewed in calculus notation, this tells us that \(N'(100) = 12\) (shares per day) and \(S'(100) = 0.75\) (dollars per share per day). At what rate is the value of the investor's total holdings changing on day 100?
