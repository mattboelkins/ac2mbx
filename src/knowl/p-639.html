Indeed, what we observe is that it's not the fact that \(f\) and \(g\) both approach zero that matters most, but rather the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">rate</em> at which each approaches zero that determines the value of the limit. This is a good way to remember what L'Hopital's Rule says: if \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\), the the limit of \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) as \(x \to a\) is given by the ratio of the slopes of \(f\) and \(g\) at \(x = a\).
