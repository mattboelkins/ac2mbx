In <a knowl="./knowl/F_4.1.NegVel.html" knowl-id="xref-F_4.1.NegVel" alt="Figure 4.1.9 " title="Figure 4.1.9 ">FigureÂ 4.1.9</a>, we see how the distances we computed above can be viewed as areas: \(A_1 = 4.5\) comes from taking rate times time (\(3 \cdot 1.5\)), as do \(A_2\) and \(A_3\) for the second and third rectangles. The big new issue is that while \(A_2\) is an area (and is therefore positive), because this area involves an interval on which the velocity function is negative, its area has a negative sign associated with it. This helps us to distinguish between distance traveled and change in position.
