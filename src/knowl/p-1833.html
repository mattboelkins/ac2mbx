In <a href="S_7.2.Qualitative.html" alt="Section 7.2 Qualitative behavior of solutions to DEs" title="Section 7.2 Qualitative behavior of solutions to DEs">SectionsÂ 7.2</a> and <a href="S_7.3.Euler.html" alt="Section 7.3 Euler's method" title="Section 7.3 Euler's method">7.3</a>, we have seen several ways to approximate the solution to
an initial value problem. Given the frequency with which differential equations arise in the world around us, we would like to have some techniques
for finding explicit algebraic solutions of certain initial value
problems. In this section, we focus on a particular class of differential
equations (called <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">separable</em>) and develop a method for finding
algebraic formulas for solutions to these equations.
