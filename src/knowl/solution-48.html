<li id="li-1248">In the graph below,
<img width="100%" src="images/3_1_Act3Soln.png">\(h(x) = x^2 + \cos(3x)\) is given in dark blue, while \(h(x) = x^2 + \cos(1.6x)\) is shown in light blue.  Close inspection of the light blue graph reveals some subtle changes in concavity around \(x \approx \pm 0.5\).  For values smaller than \(1.6\), it is very hard to visually detect any inflection points in \(h(x)\).</li>
<li id="li-1249">Treating \(k\) as an arbitrary constant, we first observe that \(h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)\). Again treating \(k\) as a constant and differentiating, we find
		
<span class="displaymath" id="me-311">\[
h''(x) = 2 - k^2\cos(kx).
\]</span>
 
		We seek the values of \(x\) for which \(h''(x) = 0\) at which \(h''\) changes sign.  Setting \(h''(x) = 0\) and rearranging the resulting equation, we now seek \(x\) such that 
		
<span class="displaymath" id="me-312">\[
k^2 \cos(kx) = 2,
\]</span>
 
		or
		
<span class="displaymath" id="me-313">\[
\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}.
\]</span>
 
		Now, remember that \(k\) is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that \(-1 \le \cos(\theta) \le 1\) for all input values \(\theta\).  If \(\frac{2}{k^2} &gt; 1\), then the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solution.  Hence, whenever \(k^2 \lt  2\), or \(k \lt  \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), it follows that the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solutions \(x\), which means that \(h''(x)\) is never zero (indeed, for these \(k\)-values, \(h''(x)\) is always positive so that \(h\) is always concave up).
		
On the other hand, if \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\), then \(\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1\), which guarantees that \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function.  At each such point, \(h''(x) = 2 - k^2 \cos(kx)\) changes sign, and therefore \(h\) has infinitely many inflection points whenever \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\).</li>
<li id="li-1250">To see why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical values regardless of the value of \(k\), consider the equation
		
<span class="displaymath" id="me-314">\[
0 = h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx),
\]</span>
 
		which implies that \(2x = k\sin(kx)\).  Since \(-1 \le \sin(kx) \le 1\), we know that \(-k \le k\sin(kx) \le k\).  Once \(|x|\) is sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that \(|2x| &gt; k\), which means that for large \(x\), \(2x\) and \(k\sin(kx)\) cannot intersect.   Moreover, for relatively small values of \(x\), the functions \(2x\) and \(k\sin(kx)\) can only intersect finitely many times since \(k\sin(kx)\) oscillates a finite number of times.  This is why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical values, regardless of the value of \(k\).</li>
