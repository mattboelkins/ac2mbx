As we will see in more detail in the following section, derivatives also help us to understand families of functions that differ only by changing one or more parameters. For instance, we might be interested in understanding the behavior of all functions of the form \(f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k\) where \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) are numbers that may vary. In the following activity, we investigate a particular example where the value of a single parameter has considerable impact on how the graph appears.
