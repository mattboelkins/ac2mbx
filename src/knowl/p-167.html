Note that this central difference has the exact same value as the average of the forward difference and backward difference (and it is straightforward to explain why this always holds), and moreover that the central difference yields a very good approximation to the derivative's value, in part because the secant line that uses both a point before and after the point of tangency yields a line that is closer to being parallel to the tangent line.
