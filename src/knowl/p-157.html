In alternate notation, we also sometimes equivalently write \(\frac{df}{dx}\) or \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) instead of \(f'(x)\), and these notations helps us to further see the units (and thus the meaning) of the derivative as it is viewed as <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\)</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;instantaneous rate of change\lt /main&gt;}. Note that the units on the slope of the secant line, \(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\), are “units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\).” Thus, when we take the limit to get \(f'(x)\), we get these same units on the derivative \(f'(x)\): units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\). Regardless of the function \(f\) under consideration (and regardless of the variables being used), it is helpful to remember that the units on the derivative function are “units of output per unit of input,” in terms of the input and output of the original function.
