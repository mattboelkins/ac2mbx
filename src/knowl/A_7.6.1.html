</h5>
<p id="p-1930">
Our first model will be based on the following assumption:
</p>
<!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">The rate of change of the population is proportional to the
      population.  
    </em><p id="p-1931">
On the face of it, this seems pretty reasonable. When there is a
relatively small number of people, there will be fewer births and
deaths so the rate of change will be small. When there is a larger
number of people, there will be more births and deaths so we expect
a larger rate of change.
</p>
<p id="p-1932">
If \(P(t)\) is the population \(t\) years after the year 2000, we may
express this assumption as
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-759">\[

  \frac{dP}{dt} = kP
  
\]</span><p id="p-1933">
where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality.
</p>
<ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-2688">Use the data in the table to estimate the derivative \(P'(0)\)
  using a central difference.  Assume that \(t=0\) corresponds to the
  year 2000.</li>
<li id="li-2689">What is the population \(P(0)\)?</li>
<li id="li-2690">Use these two facts to estimate the constant of proportionality
  \(k\) in the differential equation.</li>
<li id="li-2691">Now that we know the value of \(k\), we have the initial
  value problem
  
<span class="displaymath" id="me-760">\[

    \frac{dP}{dt} = kP, \ P(0) = 6.084.
  
\]</span>
 
  Find the solution to this initial value problem.</li>
<li id="li-2692">What does your solution predict for the population in the year
  2010?  Is this close to the actual population given in the table?</li>
<li id="li-2693">When does your solution predict that the population will reach
  12 billion?</li>
<li id="li-2694">What does your solution predict for the population in the year
  2500?</li>
<li id="li-2695">Do you think this is a reasonable model for the earth's
  population?  Why or why not?  Explain your thinking using a couple
  of complete sentences.</li>
