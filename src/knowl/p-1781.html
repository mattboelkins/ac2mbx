\item A slope field is a plot created by graphing the tangent lines of
many different solutions to a differential equation.
\item Once we have a slope field, we may sketch the graph of solutions
by drawing a curve that is always tangent to the lines in the slope
field.
\item Autonomous differential equations sometimes have constant
solutions that we call
equilibrium solutions. These may be classified as stable or
unstable, depending on the behavior of nearby solutions.
