One of the challenges of differentiating a composite function is that it often cannot be written in an alternate algebraic form. For instance, the function \(C(x) = \sin(x^2)\) cannot be expanded or otherwise rewritten, so it presents no alternate approaches to taking the derivative. But other composite functions can be expanded or simplified, and these present a way to begin to explore how the chain rule might have to work. To that end, we consider two examples of composite functions that present alternate means of finding the derivative.
