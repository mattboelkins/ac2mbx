\item Suppose that \(b(t)\) measures the number of bacteria living in
a colony in a Petri dish, where \(b\) is measured in thousands and
\(t\) is measured in days. One day, you measure that there are
6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3. A few days
later, you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per
capita growth rate is 2.
