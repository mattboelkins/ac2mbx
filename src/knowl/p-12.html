Informally, we define the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">instantaneous velocity</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;instantaneous velocity\lt /main&gt;} of a moving object at time \(t = a\) to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing \(t = a\) to compute the average velocity. We will develop a more formal definition of this momentarily, one that will end up being the foundation of much of our work in first semester calculus. For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity this way: take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals, and if those average velocities approach a single number, then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.
