The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics. Sometimes called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">circular</em> functions due to their genesis in the unit circle
, these periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as the location of a point on a bicycle tire, the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring, tidal elevations, and more. Like polynomial and exponential functions, the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions, ones that are often used in the building of more complicated functions. As such, we would like to know formulas for \(\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]\) and \(\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)]\), and the next two activities lead us to that end.
