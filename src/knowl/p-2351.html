We next extend the approach in Preview <a href="S_8.5.Taylor.html#PA_8.5" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a> to arbitrary functions at arbitrary points. Let \(f\) be a function that has as many derivatives at a point \(x=a\) as we need. Since first learning it in <a href="S_1.8.TanLineApprox.html" alt="Section 1.8 The Tangent Line Approximation" title="Section 1.8 The Tangent Line Approximation">Section 1.8</a>, we have regularly used the linear approximation \(P_1(x)\) to \(f\) at \(x=a\), which in one sense is the best linear approximation to \(f\) near \(a\). Recall that \(P_1(x)\) is the tangent line to \(f\) at \((a,f(a))\) and is given by the formula
