Among all functions, linear functions are simplest. One of the powerful consequences of a function \(y = f(x)\) being differentiable at a point \((a,f(a))\) is that, up close, the function \(y = f(x)\) is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point. In certain circumstances, this allows us to approximate the original function \(f\) with a simpler function \(L\) that is linear: this can be advantageous when we have limited information about \(f\) or when \(f\) is computationally or algebraically complicated. We will explore all of these situations in what follows.
