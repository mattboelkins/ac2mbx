Notice that the value of \(C\) is connected to the initial value of the
velocity \(v(0)\), since \(v(0) = 3+C\). In other words, while the
differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself, this is not enough information to determine the velocity
uniquely: we also need to know the initial velocity. For this
reason, differential equations will typically have infinitely many
solutions, one corresponding to each initial value. We have seen this phenomenon before, such as when given the velocity of a moving object
\(v(t)\), we were not able to uniquely determine the object's position
unless we also know its initial position.
