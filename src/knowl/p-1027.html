where we examine the effect of multiplying a function by a factor of 2 on the area it bounds with the \(x\)-axis. Because multiplying the function by 2 doubles its height at every \(x\)-value, we see that if we consider a typical rectangle from a Riemann sum, the difference in area comes from the changed height of the rectangle: \(f(x_i)\) for the original function, versus \(2f(x_i)\) in the doubled function, in the case of left sum. Hence, in <a knowl="./knowl/F_4.3.ConstMult.html" knowl-id="xref-F_4.3.ConstMult" alt="Figure 4.3.10 " title="Figure 4.3.10 ">FigureÂ 4.3.10</a>, we see that for the pictured rectangles with areas \(A\) and \(B\), it follows \(B = 2A\). As this will happen in every such rectangle, regardless of the value of \(n\) and the type of sum we use, we see that in the limit, the area of the red region bounded by \(y = 2f(x)\) will be twice that of the area of the blue region bounded by \(y = f(x)\). As there is nothing special about the value \(2\) compared to an arbitrary constant \(k\), it turns out that the following general principle holds.
