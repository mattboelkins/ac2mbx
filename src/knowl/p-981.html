\item A Riemann sum is simply a sum of products of the form \(f(x_i^*) \triangle x\) that estimates the area between a positive function and the horizontal axis over a given interval. If the function is sometimes negative on the interval, the Riemann sum estimates the difference between the areas that lie above the horizontal axis and those that lie below the axis.
\item The three most common types of Riemann sums are left, right, and middle sums, plus we can also work with a more general, random Riemann sum. The only difference among these sums is the location of the point at which the function is evaluated to determine the height of the rectangle whose area is being computed in the sum. For a left Riemann sum, we evaluate the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval, while for right and middle sums, we use right endpoints and midpoints, respectively.
\item The left, right, and middle Riemann sums are denoted \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\), with formulas
