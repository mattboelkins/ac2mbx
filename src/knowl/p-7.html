Not only does such a moving object have a position associated with its motion, but on any time interval, the object has an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">average velocity</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;average velocity\lt /main&gt;}. Think, for example, about driving from one location to another: the vehicle travels some number of miles over a certain time interval (measured in hours), from which we can compute the vehicle's average velocity. In this situation, average velocity is the number of miles traveled divided by the time elapsed, which of course is given in <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">miles per hour</em>. Similarly, the calculation of \(AV_{[0.5,1]}\) in Preview <a href="S_1.1.Velocity.html#PA_1.1" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> found the average velocity of the ball on the time interval \([0.5,1]\), measured in feet per second.
