with the denominator being simply \(h\) because \((a+h) - a = h\). Initially, it is fine to think of \(h\) being a small positive real number; but it is important to note that we allow \(h\) to be a small negative number, too, as this enables us to investigate the average velocity of the moving object on intervals prior to \(t = a\), as well as following \(t = a\). When \(h \lt  0\), \(AV_{[a,a+h]}\) measures the average velocity on the interval \([a+h,a]\).
