Now, we know that \(f'(2)\) represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y = x - x^2\) at the point \((2,-2)\); \(f'(2)\) is also the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) at the point \((2,-2)\). Graphing both the function and the line through \((2,-2)\) with slope \(m = f'(2) = -3\), we indeed see that by calculating the derivative, we have found the slope of the tangent line at this point, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.3.Ex1.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.3.Ex1" alt="Figure 1.3.7 " title="Figure 1.3.7 ">FigureÂ 1.3.7</a>.
