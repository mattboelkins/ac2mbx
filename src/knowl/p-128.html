This observation is consistent with the specific values we found above: e.g., \(f'(3) = 4 - 2(3) = -2\). And indeed, our work with \(a\) confirms that while the particular value of \(a\) at which we evaluate the derivative affects the value of the derivative, that value has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative. We note further that the letter being used is immaterial: whether we call it \(a\), \(x\), or anything else, the derivative at a given value is simply given by “4 minus 2 times the value.” We choose to use \(x\) for consistency with the original function given by \(y = f(x)\), as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function, and thus we have found that for the function \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\), it follows that \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x.\)
