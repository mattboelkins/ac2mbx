<span class="solution"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Solution</span> <span class="codenumber">3.4.2.2</span></span><p id="p-807">
We begin by letting \(x\) be the distance from \(Z\) to \(Q\). Since it is 3 km from \(P\) to \(Q\), the distance from \(P\) to \(Z\) is \(3-x\). Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from \(Z\) to the cabin is \(\sqrt{4+x^2}\).
</p>
<p id="p-808">
Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of \(x\). Because distance equals rate times time, time is thus distance divided by rate. Along the road, the hiker's distance is \(3-x\) km and her rate is \(8\) km/hr, thus her time on the road, \(T_r\) is
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-342">\[
T_r = \frac{3-x}{8}.
\]</span><p id="p-809">
Once she enters the woods, her rate drops to \(3\) km/hr and travels a distance of \(\sqrt{4+x^2}\) km, making her time in the woods, \(T_w\), given by
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-343">\[
T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}.
\]</span><p id="p-810">
Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-344">\[
T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}.
\]</span><p id="p-811">
Because the only values of \(x\) that make sense to use are \(0 \le x \le 3\) (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip), we use this domain for \(T\) and now seek the absolute minimum of \(T\) on \([0,3]\). First, we find that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-345">\[
T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4+x^2)^{-1/2} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}.
\]</span><p id="p-812">
Setting \(T'(x) = 0\) and solving for \(x\), we have \(\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}\), so \(8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}\). Squaring both sides, \(64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2\). Hence, \(55x^2 = 36\), so \(x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.80904\). (We don't consider the critical value \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}\) because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of \(T\).)
</p>
<p id="p-813">
Finally, we evaluate \(T\) at the only critical value in the interval and at the interval's endpoints. Doing so, we find \(T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417\), \(T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}{3}} \approx 1.20185\), and \(T(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.99302\), and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is \(0.99302\) hours, which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from \(P\) to \(Q\) and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.
