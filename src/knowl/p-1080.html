But finding an antiderivative can be far from simple; in fact, often finding a formula for an antiderivative is very hard or even impossible. While we can differentiate just about any function, even some relatively simple ones don't have an elementary antiderivative. A significant portion of integral calculus (which is the main focus of second semester college calculus) is devoted to understanding the problem of finding antiderivatives.
