</h5>See the plot below.  Note that \(y = f(x)\) is concave up for \(x \lt  2\) since \(f'\) is increasing on that interval, and \(y = f(x)\) is concave down for \(x &gt; 2\) since \(f'\) is decreasing there.  Hence \(y = f(x)\) changes from concave up to concave down right at \(x = 2\), which is also the point near 2 where the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is steepest.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.8.TanLineApprox.html#li-557">in-context</a></span>
