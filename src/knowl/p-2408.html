We now know how to find Taylor polynomials for functions such as \(\sin(x)\), as well as how to determine the interval of convergence of the corresponding Taylor series. We next develop an error bound that will tell us how well an \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial \(P_n(x)\) approximates its generating function \(f(x)\). This error bound will also allow us to determine whether a Taylor series on its interval of convergence actually equals the function \(f\) from which the Taylor series is derived. Finally, we will be able to use the error bound to determine the order of the Taylor polynomial \(P_n(x)\) for a function \(f\) that we need to ensure that \(P_n(x)\) approximates \(f(x)\) to any desired degree of accuracy.
