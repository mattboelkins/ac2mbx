If we consider the formula \(m = d \cdot V\), it is reminiscent of two other equations that we have used frequently in recent work: for a body moving in a fixed direction, distance = rate \(\cdot\) time, and, for a rectangle, its area is given by \(A = l \cdot w\). These formulas hold when the principal quantities involved, such as the rate the body moves and the height of the rectangle, are <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">constant</em>. When these quantities are not constant, we have turned to the definite integral for assistance. The main idea in each situation is that by working with small slices of the quantity that is varying, we can use a definite integral to add up the values of small pieces on which the quantity of interest (such as the velocity of a moving object) are approximately constant.
