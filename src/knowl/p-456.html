The quotient rule has thus enabled us to determine the derivatives of the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions, expanding our overall library of basic functions we can differentiate. Moreover, we observe that just as the derivative of any polynomial function is a polynomial, and the derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function, so it is that the derivative of any basic trigonometric function is another function that consists of basic trigonometric functions. This makes sense because all trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence their derivatives will be periodic, too.
