<span class="solution"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Solution</span> <span class="codenumber">3.1.3.1</span></span><ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-1235">Based on the given graph of \(g''\), the only point at which \(g''\) changes sign is \(x = -1\), and hence this is an inflection point of \(g\).</li>
<li id="li-1236">Note that \(g''(x) &gt; 0\) for \(x \lt  -1\), \(g''(x) \lt  0\) for \(-1 \lt  x \lt  2\), and \(g''(x) \lt  0\) for \(x &gt; 2\).  This tells us that \(g\) is concave up for \(x \lt  -1\), concave down for \(-1 \lt  x \lt  2\), and concave down for \(x &gt; 2\).</li>
<li id="li-1237">Given that \(g'(-1.67857351) = 0\), we know that \(g\) has a horizontal tangent line at this critical value.  In addition, from the given graph of \(g''\), we see that \(g''( -1.67857351) &gt; 0\) and observe that \(g\) is concave up at \(x\)-values near \(-1.67857351\).  By the second derivative test, \(g\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1.67857351\).</li>
<li id="li-1238">From the given graph, since \(g''\) has a simple zero at \(x = -1\) and a repeated zero at \(x = 2\), it appears that \(g''\) is a degree 3 polynomial.  If so, then \(g'\) is a degree 4 polynomial, and \(g\) is a degree 5 polynomial.</li>
