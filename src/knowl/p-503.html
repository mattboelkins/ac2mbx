Solution.    
We first observe that the most basic structure of \(h\) is that it is the product of two functions: \(h(t) = a(t) \cdot b(t)\) where \(a(t) = 3^{t^2 + 2t}\) and \(b(t) = \sec^4(t)\). Therefore, we see that we will need to use the product rule to differentiate \(h\). When it comes time to differentiate \(a\) and \(b\) in their roles in the product rule, we observe that since each is a composite function, the chain rule will be needed. We therefore begin by working separately to compute \(a'(t)\) and \(b'(t)\).
