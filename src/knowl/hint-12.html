<li id="li-93">Remember that average velocity on an interval computes the quotient of “change in \(s\) over change in \(t\).”  This is the slope of the line between the corresponding two points on the graph of \(s\).  For example, the average velocity on \([0.5,1]\) is \(\frac{1-1}{1-0.5} = 0\).</li>
<li id="li-94">Think about shorter and shorter time intervals and drawing the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.  If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity.</li>
<li id="li-95">Think about zooming in on the graph at \(t = 2\) and drawing a line that, up close, looks just like the curve \(s(t)\).  What is the approximate slope of that line?  By drawing this line that looks like \(s(t)\) near the point \((2,s(2))\) and comparing the line through the points \((1.5,s(1.5))\) and \((2.5, s(2.5))\), you should be able to compare the lines and see which has greater slope.</li>
