\item The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function \(y = f(x)\) is differentiable, the function should become indistinguishable from its tangent line. That is, a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close. We rename the tangent line to be the function \(y = L(x)\) where \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\) and note that \(f(x) \approx L(x)\) for all \(x\) near \(x = a\).
\item If we know the tangent line approximation \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\), then because \(L(a) = f(a)\) and \(L'(a) = f'(a)\), we also know both the value and the derivative of the function \(y = f(x)\) at the point where \(x = a\). In other words, the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function. If, in addition, we know the value of \(f''(a)\), we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of \(y = f(x)\) depending on the concavity of \(f\).
