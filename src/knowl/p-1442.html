Finally, we make two important notes about Simpson's Rule. When T. Simpson first developed this rule, his idea was to replace the function \(f\) on a given interval with a quadratic function that shared three values with the function \(f\). In so doing, he guaranteed that this new approximation rule would be exact for the definite integral of any quadratic polynomial. In one of the pleasant surprises of numerical analysis, it turns out that even though it was designed to be exact for quadratic polynomials, Simpson's Rule is exact for any cubic polynomial: that is, if we are interested in an integral such as \(\int_2^5 (5x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 4)\, dx\), \(S_n\) will always be exact, regardless of the value of \(n\). This is just one more piece of evidence that shows how effective Simpson's Rule is as an approximation tool for estimating definite integrals.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-41" id="fn-41"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 4 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-41" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">One reason that Simpson's Rule is so effective is that \(S_n\) benefits from using \(2n+1\) points of data.  Because it combines \(M_n\), which uses \(n\) midpoints, and \(T_n\), which uses the \(n+1\) endpoints of the chosen subintervals, \(S_n\) takes advantage of the maximum amount of information we have when we know function values at the endpoints and midpoints of \(n\) subintervals.</span></span>
