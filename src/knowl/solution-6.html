<li id="li-96">The average velocity on \([0.5,1]\) is the slope of the line joining the points \((0.5,s(0.5))\) and \((1,s(1))\), which is \(AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{1-1}{1-0.5} = 0\).  On \([1.5,2.5]\), we similarly find \(AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = \frac{3-1}{2.5-1.5} = 2\), and on \([0,5]\), we have \(AV_{[0,5]} = \frac{5-0}{5-0} = 1\).</li>
<li id="li-97">Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.  If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity.  For example, to estimate the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 2\), we might consider average velocities on \([2,3]\), \([2,2.5]\), and \([2,2.25]\).</li>
<li id="li-98">If we draw the line through \((2,2)\) and \((2.1,s(2.1))\), it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5: if we go over one grid-width, we appear to go up about 2.5.  The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through \((1.5, s(1.5))\) and \((2.5, s(2.5))\), which is 2. Hence the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 2\) is greater than the average velocity on \([1.5,2.5]\).</li>
