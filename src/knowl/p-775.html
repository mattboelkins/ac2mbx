In sequence, from left to right, as we see the interval under consideration change from \([-2,3]\) to \([-2,2]\) to \([-2,1]\), we move from having two critical numbers in the interval with the absolute minimum at one critical number and the absolute maximum at the right endpoint, to still having both critical numbers in the interval but then with the absolute minimum and maximum at the two critical numbers, to finally having just one critical number in the interval with the absolute maximum at one critical number and the absolute minimum at one endpoint. It is particularly essential to always remember to only consider the critical numbers that lie within the interval.
