In a similar way, if we know that the velocity of a moving object is given by the function \(y = v(t)\), and we wish to know the distance the object travels on an interval \([a,b]\) where \(v(t)\) is nonnegative, we can use a definite integral to generalize the fact that \(d = r \cdot t\) when the rate, \(r\), is constant. More specifically, on a short time interval \(\triangle t\), \(v(t)\) is roughly constant, and hence for a small slice of time, \(d_{\mbox{{slice}} } = v(t) \triangle t\), and so as the width of the time interval \(\triangle t\) tends to zero, the exact distance traveled is given by the definite integral
