Because an algebraic formula for an antiderivative of \(f\) enables us to evaluate the definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly, we see that we have a natural interest in being able to find such algebraic antiderivatives. Note that we emphasize <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">algebraic</em> antiderivatives, as opposed to any antiderivative, since we know by the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that \(G(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\) is indeed an antiderivative of the given function \(f\), but one that still involves a definite integral. One of our main goals in this section and the one following is to develop understanding, in select circumstances, of how to “undo” the process of differentiation in order to find an algebraic antiderivative for a given function.
