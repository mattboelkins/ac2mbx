</h5>By observation we see that a formula for \(s_n\) is \(s_n = \frac{1}{n}\). A plot of the first 50 points in the sequence is shown here.
Since we can make the values of \(\frac{1}{n}\) in our sequence as close to 0 as we want by choosing \(n\) to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence has a limit of 0 as \(n\) goes to infinity.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_8.1.Sequences.html#li-2737">in-context</a></span>
