In <a href="S_1.4.DerivativeFxn.html" alt="Section 1.4 The derivative function" title="Section 1.4 The derivative function">Section 1.4</a>, we learned how use to the graph of a given function \(f\) to plot the graph of its derivative, \(f'\). It is important to remember that when we do so, not only does the scale on the vertical axis often have to change to accurately represent \(f'\), but the units on that axis also differ. For example, suppose that \(P(t) = 400-330e^{-0.03t}\) tells us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of a potato in an oven at time \(t\) in minutes. In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.5.PPprime.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.5.PPprime" alt="Figure 1.5.7 " title="Figure 1.5.7 ">Figure 1.5.7</a>, we sketch the graph of \(P\) on the left and the graph of \(P'\) on the right.
