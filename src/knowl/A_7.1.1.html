<li id="li-2452">A cup of hot chocolate is sitting in a 70\(^\circ\) room.
          The temperature of the hot chocolate cools continuously by 10% of
          the difference between the hot chocolate's temperature and
          the room temperature every minute.</li>
<li id="li-2453">A can of cold soda is sitting in a 70\(^\circ\) room.
          The temperature of the soda warms continuously at the rate of 10% of
