In words, the Sum Rule tells us that “the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.” It also tells us that any time we take a sum of two differentiable functions, the result must also be differentiable. Furthermore, because we can view the difference function \(y = (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)\) as \(y = f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))\), the Sum Rule and Constant Multiple Rules together tell us that \(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))] = f'(x) - g'(x)\), or that “the derivative of a difference is the difference of the derivatives.” Hence we can now compute derivatives of sums and differences of elementary functions. For instance, \(\frac{d}{dw} (2^w + w^2) = 2^w \ln(2) + 2w\), and if \(h(q) = 3q^6 - 4q^{-3}\), then \(h'(q) = 3 (6q^5) - 4(-3q^{-4}) = 18q^5 + 12q^{-4}\).
