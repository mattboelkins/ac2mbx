From the left table, it appears that we can make \(f\) as close as we want to 3 by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(-1\), which suggests that \(\ds \lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = 3\).	This is also consistent with the graph of \(f\). To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view, consider the formula for \(f\): \(f(x) = \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}\). The numerator and denominator are each polynomial functions, which are among the most well-behaved functions that exist. Formally, such functions are <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">continuous</em><span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 2 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-2" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">See <a href="S_1.7.LimContDiff.html" alt="Section 1.7 Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability" title="Section 1.7 Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability">Section 1.7</a> for more on the notion of continuity.</span></span>, which means that the limit of the function at any point is equal to its function value. Here, it follows that as \(x \to -1\), \((4-x^2) \to (4 - (-1)^2) = 3\), and \((x+2) \to (-1 + 2) = 1\), so as \(x \to -1\), the numerator of \(f\) tends to 3 and the denominator tends to 1, hence \(\ds \lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = \frac{3}{1} = 3\).
