Given a family of functions that depends on one or more parameters, our goal is to describe the key characteristics of the overall behavior of each member of the familiy in terms of those parameters. By finding the first and second derivatives and constructing first and second derivative sign charts (each of which may depend on one or more of the parameters), we can often make broad conclusions about how each member of the family will appear. The fundamental steps for this analysis are essentially identical to the work we did in <a href="S_3.1.Tests.html" alt="Section 3.1 Using derivatives to identify extreme values" title="Section 3.1 Using derivatives to identify extreme values">SectionÂ 3.1</a>, as we demonstrate through the following example.
