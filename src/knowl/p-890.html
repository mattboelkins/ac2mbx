In a much smaller number of situations so far, we have encountered the reverse situation where we instead know the derivative, \(f'\), and have tried to deduce information about \(f\). It is this particular problem that will be the focus of our attention in most of <a href="C_4.html" alt="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral" title="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral">ChapterÂ 4</a>: if we know the instantaneous rate of change of a function, are we able to determine the function itself? To begin, we start with a more focused question: if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object moving along a straight line path, can we determine its corresponding position function?
