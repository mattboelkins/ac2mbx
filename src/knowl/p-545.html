In particular, we observe that \(m_{A'} = \frac{1}{m_A}\) and \(m_{B'} = \frac{1}{m_B}\). This is not a coincidence, but in fact holds for any curve \(y = f(x)\) and its inverse, provided the inverse exists. One rationale for why this is the case is due to the reflection across \(y = x\): in so doing, we essentially change the roles of \(x\) and \(y\), thus reversing the rise and run, which leads to the slope of the inverse function at the reflected point being the reciprocal of the slope of the original function. At the close of this section, we will also look at how the chain rule provides us with an algebraic formulation of this general phenomenon.
