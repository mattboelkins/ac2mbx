For example, if a continuous function has a relative maximum at \(c\), such as those pictured in the two leftmost functions in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.extremes.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.extremes" alt="Figure 3.1.3 " title="Figure 3.1.3 ">Figure 3.1.3</a>, then it is both necessary and sufficient that the function change from being increasing just before \(c\) to decreasing just after \(c\). In the same way, a continuous function has a relative minimum at \(c\) if and only if the function changes from decreasing to increasing at \(c\). See, for instance, the two functions pictured at right in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.extremes.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.extremes" alt="Figure 3.1.3 " title="Figure 3.1.3 ">Figure 3.1.3</a>. There are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur: either \(f'(c) = 0\) or \(f'(c)\) is undefined.
