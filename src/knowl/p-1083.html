What is involved in trying to find an antiderivative for each? From our experience with derivative rules, we know that while derivatives of sums and constant multiples of basic functions are simple to execute, derivatives involving products, quotients, and composites of familiar functions are much more complicated. Thus, it stands to reason that antidifferentiating products, quotients, and composites of basic functions may be even more challenging. We defer our study of all but the most elementary antiderivatives to later in the text.
