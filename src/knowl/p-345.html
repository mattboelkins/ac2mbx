In the same way that we have shortcut rules to help us find derivatives, we introduce some language that is simpler and shorter. Often, rather than say “take the derivative of \(f\),” we'll instead say simply “differentiate \(f\).” This phrasing is tied to the notion of having a derivative to begin with: if the derivative exists at a point, we say “\(f\) is differentiable,” which is tied to the fact that \(f\) can be differentiated.
