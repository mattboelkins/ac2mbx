Of course, similar options hold for how a function can decrease. Here we must be extra careful with our language, since decreasing functions involve negative slopes, and negative numbers present an interesting situation in the tension between common language and mathematical language. For example, it can be tempting to say that “\(-100\) is bigger than \(-2\).” But we must remember that when we say one number is greater than another, this describes how the numbers lie on a number line: \(x \lt  y\) provided that \(x\) lies to the left of \(y\). So of course, \(-100\) is less than \(-2\). Informally, it might be helpful to say that “\(-100\) is more negative than \(-2\).” This leads us to note particularly that when a function's values are negative, and those values subsequently get more negative, the function must be decreasing.
