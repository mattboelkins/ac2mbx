It turns out that our work in <a knowl="./knowl/x8.6.Act2.html" knowl-id="xref-x8.6.Act2" alt="Exercise 8.6.6 " title="Exercise 8.6.6 ">ActivityÂ 8.6.6</a> holds more generally. The corresponding theorem, which we will not prove, states that we can differentiate a power series for a function \(f\) term by term and obtain the series expansion for \(f'\), and similarly we can integrate a series expansion for a function \(f\) term by term and obtain the series expansion for \(\ds \int f(x) \ dx\). For both, the radius of convergence of the resulting series is the same as the original, though it is possible that the convergence status of the resulting series may differ at the endpoints. The formal statement of the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem follows.
