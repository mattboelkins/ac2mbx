Of course, we can also explore what happens when certain aspects of the problem change. For instance, let's suppose we are at a time when the plastic pollution entering Lake Michigan has
stabilized at \(1.5\cdot10^5\) cubic meters, and that new legislation is
passed to prevent this type of pollution entering the lake. So, there is no longer any inflow of plastic pollution to the lake. How does the amount of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan now change? For example, how long does it take for the amount of plastic pollution in the lake to halve?
