Points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.Ex2" alt="Figure 3.1.11 " title="Figure 3.1.11 ">FigureÂ 3.1.11</a> are locations at which the concavity of \(f\) changes. We give a special name to any such point: if \(p\) is a value in the domain of a continuous function \(f\) at which \(f\) changes concavity, then we say that \((p,f(p))\) is an <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">inflection point</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;inflection point\lt /main&gt;} of \(f\). Just as we look for locations where \(f\) changes from increasing to decreasing at points where \(f'(p) = 0\) or \(f'(p)\) is undefined, so too we find where \(f''(p) = 0\) or \(f''(p)\) is undefined to see if there are points of inflection at these locations.
