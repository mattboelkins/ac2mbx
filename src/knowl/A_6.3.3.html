Consider a thin bar of length 20 cm whose density is distributed according to the function \(\rho(x) = 4 + 0.1x\), where \(x = 0\) represents the left end of the bar. Assume that \(\rho\) is measured in g/cm and \(x\) is measured in cm.

<ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-2328">Find the total mass, \(M\), of the bar.</li>
<li id="li-2329">Without doing any calculations, do you expect the center of mass of the bar to be equal to 10, less than 10, or greater than 10?  Why?</li>
<li id="li-2330">Compute \(\overline{x}\), the exact center of mass of the bar.</li>
<li id="li-2331">What is the average density of the bar?</li>
<li id="li-2332">Now consider a different density function, given by \(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\), also for a bar of length 20 cm whose left end is at \(x = 0\).  Plot both \(\rho(x)\) and \(p(x)\) on the same axes.  Without doing any calculations, which bar do you expect to have the greater center of mass?  Why?</li>
<li id="li-2333">Compute the exact center of mass of the bar described in (e) whose density function is \(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\).  Check the result against the prediction you made in (e).</li>
