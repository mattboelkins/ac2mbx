<li id="li-2371">Consider a vertical cylindrical tank of radius 2 meters and depth 6 meters.  Suppose the tank is filled with 4 meters of water of mass density 1000 kg/m\(^3\), and the top 1 meter of water is pumped over the top of the tank.</li>
<li id="li-2372">Consider a hemispherical tank with a radius of 10 feet.  Suppose that the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet with water of weight density 62.4 pounds/ft\(^3\), and the top 5 feet of water are pumped out of the tank to a tanker truck whose height is 5 feet above the top of the tank.</li>

Say that the trough is full to within 1 foot of the top with water of weight density 62.4 pounds/ft\(^3\), and a pump is used to empty the tank until the water remaining in the tank is 1 foot deep.</li>
