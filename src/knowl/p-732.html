In addition, there are several basic situations that we already understand completely. For instance, every function of the form \(y = mx + b\) is a line with slope \(m\) and \(y\)-intercept \((0,b)\). Note that this form allows us to consider every possible line through two parameters. Further, we understand that the value of \(m\) affects the line's steepness and whether the line rises or falls from left to right, while the value of \(b\) situates the line vertically on the coordinate axes.
