<li id="li-459">\(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) does not exist at \(a = -2\) since \(\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = 2 \ne -1 = \lim_{x \to -2^+}\) and \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) does not exist at \(a = +2\) since \(\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x)\) does not exist due to the infinitely oscillatory behavior of \(f\).</li>
<li id="li-460">The only point at which \(f\) is not defined is at \(a = 3\).</li>
<li id="li-461">At \(x = -1\), note that \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x)\) exists (and appears to have value approximately \(-3.25\)), but \(f(-1) = 1\), and thus \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) \ne f(-1)\).  At \(x = 3\), \(\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) = -2.5\), but \(f(3)\) is not defined, so the limit exists but does not equal the function value.</li>
<li id="li-462">Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c), \(f\) is not continuous at \(a=-2\) and \(a = 2\) because \(f\) does not have a limit at those points; \(f\) is not continuous at \(a = 3\) since \(f\) is not defined there; and \(f\) is not continuous at \(a = -1\) because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.</li>
<li id="li-463">“If \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\), then \(f\) has a limit at \(x = a\),” since one of the defining properties of “being continuous” at \(x = a\) is that the function has a limit at that input value.  This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.</li>
