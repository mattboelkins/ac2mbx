Note how not only are the vertical scales different in size, but different in units, as the units of \(P\) are \(^{\circ}\)F, while those of \(P'\) are \(^{\circ}\)F/min. In all cases where we work with functions that have an applied context, it is helpful and instructive to think carefully about units involved and how they further inform the meaning of our computations.
