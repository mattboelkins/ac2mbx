\item For each graph that provides an original function \(y = f(x)\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.4.Ez3a.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.4.Ez3a" alt="Figure 1.4.7 " title="Figure 1.4.7 ">FigureÂ 1.4.7</a> (on the following page), your task is to sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function, \(y = f'(x)\), on the axes immediately below. View the scale of the grid for the graph of \(f\) as being \(1 \times 1\), and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of \(f'\) is identical to that for \(f\). If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of \(f'\), you should label that accordingly.
