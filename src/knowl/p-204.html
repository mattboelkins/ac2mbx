Now consider the three graphs shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.6.3optsd.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.6.3optsd" alt="Figure 1.6.7 " title="Figure 1.6.7 ">FigureÂ 1.6.7</a>. Clearly the middle graph demonstrates the behavior of a function decreasing at a constant rate. If we think about a sequence of tangent lines to the first curve that progress from left to right, we see that the slopes of these lines get less and less negative as we move from left to right. That means that the values of the first derivative, while all negative, are increasing, and thus we say that the leftmost curve is <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">decreasing at an increasing rate</em>.
