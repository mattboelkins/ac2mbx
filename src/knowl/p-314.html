In <a href="C_1.html" alt="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative" title="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative">ChapterÂ 1</a>, we developed the concept of the derivative of a function. We now know that the derivative \(f'\) of a function \(f\) measures the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) as well as the slope of the tangent line to \(y=f(x)\) at any given value of \(x\). To date, we have focused primarily on interpreting the derivative graphically or, in the context of functions in a physical setting, as a meaningful rate of change. To actually calculate the value of the derivative at a specific point, we have typically relied on the limit definition of the derivative.
