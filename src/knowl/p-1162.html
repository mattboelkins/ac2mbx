\item Given the graph of a function \(f\), we can construct the graph of its antiderivative \(F\) provided that (a) we know a starting value of \(F\), say \(F(a)\), and (b) we can evaluate the integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly for relevant choices of \(a\) and \(b\). For instance, if we wish to know \(F(3)\), we can compute \(F(3) = F(a) + \int_a^3 f(x) \, dx\). When we combine this information about the function values of \(F\) together with our understanding of how the behavior of \(F' = f\) affects the overall shape of \(F\), we can develop a completely accurate graph of the antiderivative \(F\).
\item Because the derivative of a constant is zero, if \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\), it follows that \(G(x) = F(x) + C\) will also be an antiderivative of \(f\). Moreover, any two antiderivatives of a function \(f\) differ precisely by a constant. Thus, any function with at least one antiderivative in fact has infinitely many, and the graphs of any two antiderivatives will differ only by a vertical translation.
\item Given a function \(f\), the rule \(A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\) defines a new function \(A\) that measures the net-signed area bounded by \(f\) on the interval \([a,x]\). We call the function \(A\) the integral function corresponding to \(f\).
