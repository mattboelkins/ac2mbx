</h5>The graphs of the 10th (magenta), 20th (blue), and 30th (green) Taylor polynomials centered at 0 for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) are shown below along with the graph of \(f(x)\) in red:

It appears that as we increase the order of the Taylor polynomials, they only fit the graph of \(f\) better and better over the interval \((-1,1)\) and appear to diverge outside that interval. So it looks like the Taylor polynomials converge to \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) only on the interval \((-1,1)\).

Based on the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomials we found earlier for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\), the Taylor series for \(f(x)\) centered at 0 is
