The relationship between \(h\) and \(r\), with \(h = \frac{1}{2}r\) for all values of \(t\), enables us to transition easily between questions involving \(r\) and \(h\). Indeed, had we known this information at the problem's outset, we could have immediately simplified our work. Using \(h = \frac{1}{2}r\), it follows that since \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), we can write \(V\) solely in terms of \(r\) to have
