Now, for any small positive or negative value of \(h\), we can compute the average velocity. For instance, to obtain the average velocity on \([0.5,0.75]\), we let \(h = 0.25\), and the average velocity is \(-16 - 16(0.25) = -20\) ft/sec. To get the average velocity on \([0.4, 0.5]\), we let \(h = -0.1\), which tells us the average velocity is \(-16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\) ft/sec. Moreover, we can even explore what happens to \(AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}\) as \(h\) gets closer and closer to zero. As \(h\) approaches zero, \(-16h\) will also approach zero, and thus it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 0.5\) should be \(-16\) ft/sec.
