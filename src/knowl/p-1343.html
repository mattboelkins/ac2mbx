In this section of the text, our main goals are to better understand some classes of functions that can always be antidifferentiated, as well as to learn some options for so doing. At the same time, we want to recognize that there are many functions for which an algebraic formula for an antiderivative does not exist, and also appreciate the role that computing technology can play in helping us find antiderivatives of other complicated functions. Throughout, it is helpful to remember what we have learned so far: how to reverse the chain rule through \(u\)-substitution, how to reverse the product rule through integration by parts, and that overall, there are subtle and challenging issues to address when trying to find antiderivatives.
