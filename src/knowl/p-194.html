Simply put, an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph, and a decreasing function is one that falls as the value of the input increases. For a function that has a derivative at a point, we will also talk about whether or not the function is increasing or decreasing <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">at that point</em>. Moreover, the fact of whether or not the function is increasing, decreasing, or neither at a given point depends precisely on the value of the derivative at that point.
