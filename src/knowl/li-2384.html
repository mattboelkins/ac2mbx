</h5>Again picture the coordinate axes rotated 90 degrees clockwise so that the positive \(x\)-axis points straight down, and the positive \(y\)-axis points to the right.  Suppose that \(R\), together with its reflection across the \(x\)-axis, forms one end of a storage tank that is 10 feet long.  Suppose that the resulting tank is filled completely with water weighing 62.4 pounds per cubic foot.  Find a formula for a function that tells the amount of work required to lower the water by \(h\) feet.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_6.4.Physics.html#li-2384">in-context</a></span>
