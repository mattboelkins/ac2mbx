Our work in <a knowl="./knowl/A_7.6.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_7.6.1" alt="Exercise 7.6.1 " title="Exercise 7.6.1 ">ActivityÂ 7.6.1</a> shows that that the exponential model is fairly accurate for years
relatively close to 2000. However, if we go too far into the
future, the model predicts increasingly large rates of change, which
causes the population to grow arbitrarily large. This does not make
much sense since it is unrealistic to expect that the earth would be able to support
such a large population.
