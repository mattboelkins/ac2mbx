Suppose you have a bank account that grows by 5% every year. Let \(A(t)\) be the amount of money in the account in year \(t\).
</p>
<ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-2641">What is the rate of change of \(A\) with respect to \(t\)?</li>
<li id="li-2642">Suppose that you are also withdrawing $10,000 per year.  Write
  a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of
  \(A\).</li>
<li id="li-2643">Sketch a slope field for this differential equation, find any
  equilibrium solutions, and identify them as either stable or
  unstable.  Write a sentence or two that describes the significance
  of the stability of the equilibrium solution.</li>
<li id="li-2644">Suppose that you initially deposit $100,000 into the account.  How
  long does it take for you to deplete the account?</li>
<li id="li-2645">What is the smallest amount of money you would need to have in
  the account to guarantee that you never deplete the money in the
  account?</li>
<li id="li-2646">If your initial deposit is $300,000, how much could you
  withdraw every year without depleting the account?</li>
