</h5>The first derivative sign chart shows that \(g'(x) &gt; 0\) for \(x \lt  -4\), \(g'(x) \lt  0\) for \(-4 \lt  x \lt  1\), \(g'(x) \lt  0\) for \(1 \lt  x \lt  2\), and \(g'(x) &gt; 0\) for \(x &gt; 2\).  By the first derivative test, \(g\) has a local maximum at \(x = -4\) and neither a max nor min at \(x = 1\).  As these are the only two critical values, these are the only two locations for possible extremes.  (Note: although \(g\) changes from decreasing to increasing at \(x = 2\), this is due to a vertical asymptote, and \(g\) does not have a minimum there.)</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.1.Tests.html#li-1219">in-context</a></span>
