find the area of each rectangle, and add up the total. Obviously there are choices to make and issues to understand: how many rectangles should we use? where should we evaluate the function to decide the rectangle's height? what happens if velocity is sometimes negative? can we attain the exact area under any non-constant curve? These questions and more are ones we will study in what follows; for now it suffices to realize that the simple idea of the area of a rectangle gives us a powerful tool for estimating both distance traveled from a velocity function as well as the area under an arbitrary curve. To explore the setting of multiple rectangles to approximate area under a non-constant velocity function, see the applet found at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9U}{<tt xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/9U</tt>}.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-23" id="fn-23"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 2 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-23" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Marc Renault, calculus applets.</span></span>
