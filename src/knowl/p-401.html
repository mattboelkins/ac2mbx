Because quotients and products are closely linked, we can use the product rule to understand how to take the derivative of a quotient. In particular, let \(Q(x)\) be defined by \(Q(x) = f(x)/g(x)\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are both differentiable functions. We desire a formula for \(Q'\) in terms of \(f\), \(g\), \(f'\), and \(g'\). It turns out that \(Q\) is differentiable everywhere that \(g(x) \ne 0\). Moreover, taking the formula \(Q = f/g\) and multiplying both sides by \(g\), we can observe that
