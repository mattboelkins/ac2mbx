</h5>The value \(F''(30) \approx -0.119\), which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment \(t = 30\), the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">falling</em> at a rate of -0.119 degrees per minute per minute.  That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate.  At \(t = 31\), we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.6.SecondD.html#li-396">in-context</a></span>
