In the next part of our study, we work to understand not only <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">whether</em> the function \(f\) is increasing or decreasing at a point or on an interval, but also <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">how</em> the function \(f\) is increasing or decreasing. Comparing the two tangent lines shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.6.Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.6.Intro" alt="Figure 1.6.1 " title="Figure 1.6.1 ">Figure 1.6.1</a>, we see that at point \(A\), the value of \(f'(x)\) is positive and relatively close to zero, which coincides with the graph rising slowly. By contrast, at point \(B\), the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value, which is tied to the fact that \(f\) is decreasing rapidly at \(B\). It also makes sense to not only ask whether the value of the derivative function is positive or negative and whether the derivative is large or small, but also to ask “how is the derivative changing?”
