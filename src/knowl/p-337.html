Of course, most of the functions we encounter in mathematics are more complicated than being simply constant, a power of a variable, or a base raised to a variable power. In this section and several following, we will learn how to quickly compute the derivative of a function constructed as an algebraic combination of basic functions. For instance, we'd like to be able to understand how to take the derivative of a polynomial function such as \(p(t) = 3t^5 - 7t^4 + t^2 - 9\), which is a function made up of constant multiples and sums of powers of \(t\). To that end, we develop two new rules: the Constant Multiple Rule and the Sum Rule.
