We begin with a familiar problem: a ball being tossed straight up in the air from an initial height. From this elementary scenario, we will ask questions about how the ball is moving. These questions will lead us to begin investigating ideas that will be central throughout our study of differential calculus and that have wide-ranging consequences. In a great deal of our thinking about calculus, we will be well-served by remembering this first example and asking ourselves how the various (sometimes abstract) ideas we are considering are related to the simple act of tossing a ball straight up in the air.
