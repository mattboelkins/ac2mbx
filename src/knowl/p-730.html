Mathematicians are often interested in making general observations, say by describing patterns that hold in a large number of cases. For example, think about the Pythagorean Theorem: it doesn't tell us something about a single right triangle, but rather a fact about <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">every</em> right triangle, thus providing key information about every member of the right triangle family. In the next part of our studies, we would like to use calculus to help us make general observations about families of functions that depend on one or more parameters. People who use applied mathematics, such as engineers and economists, often encounter the same types of functions in various settings where only small changes to certain constants occur. These constants are called <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">parameters</em>.
