That the two corresponding tangent lines having slopes that are reciprocals of one another is not a coincidence. If we consider the general setting of a differentiable function \(f\) with differentiable inverse \(g\) such that \(y = f(x)\) if and only if \(x = g(y)\), then we know that \(f(g(x)) = x\) for every \(x\) in the domain of \(f^{-1}\). Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to \(x\), we have
