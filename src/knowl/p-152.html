An interesting and powerful feature of mathematics is that it can often be thought of both in abstract terms and in applied ones. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of arbitrary functions. At the same time, calculus can also be very directly connected to our experience of physical reality by considering functions that represent meaningful processes. We have already seen that for a position function \(y = s(t)\), say for a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the ball's velocity at time \(t\) is given by \(v(t) = s'(t)\), the derivative of the position function. Further, recall that if \(s(t)\) is measured in feet at time \(t\), the units on \(v(t) = s'(t)\) are feet per second.
