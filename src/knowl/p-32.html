\item A diver leaps from a 3 meter springboard. His feet leave the board at time \(t=0\), he reaches his maximum height of 4.5 m at \(t = 1.1\) seconds, and enters the water at \(t = 2.45\). Once in the water, the diver coasts to the bottom of the pool (depth 3.5 m), touches bottom at \(t=7\), rests for one second, and then pushes off the bottom. From there he coasts to the surface, and takes his first breath at \(t=13\).
