Functions are at the heart of mathematics: a function is a process or rule that associates each individual input to exactly one corresponding output. Students learn in courses prior to calculus that there are many different ways to represent functions, including through formulas, graphs, tables, and even words. For example, the squaring function can be thought of in any of these ways. In words, the squaring function takes any real number \(x\) and computes its square. The formulaic and graphical representations go hand in hand, as \(y = f(x) = x^2\) is one of the simplest curves to graph. Finally, we can also partially represent this function through a table of values, essentially by listing some of the ordered pairs that lie on the curve, such as \((-2,4)\), \((-1,1)\), \((0,0)\), \((1,1)\), and \((2,4)\).
