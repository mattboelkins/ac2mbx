When a dam is built, it is imperative to for engineers to understand how much force water will exert against the face of the dam. The first thing we realize is the force exerted by the fluid is related to the natural concept of pressure. The pressure a force exerts on a region is measured in units of force per unit of area: for example, the air pressure in a tire is often measured in pounds per square inch (PSI). Hence, we see that the general relationship is given by
