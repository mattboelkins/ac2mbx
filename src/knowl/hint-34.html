<span class="solution"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Hint</span> <span class="codenumber">1.6.4.6</span></span>Remember that to plot \(y = f'(x)\), it is helpful to first identify where \(f'(x) = 0\), and then ask where \(y = f'(x)\) is positive and negative.  In a similar way, once \(y = f'(x)\) has been plotted, to construct the graph of \(y=f''(x)\), it is useful to note where the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f'(x)\) is zero, as well as where such slopes are positive and negative.  Heights on the graph of \(y = f''(x)\) will correspond to slopes on \(y = f'(x)\).</span><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.6.SecondD.html#hint-34">in-context</a></span>
