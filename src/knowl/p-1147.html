If we instead chose to consider a function \(G\) that is an antiderivative of \(f\) but has the property that \(G(0) = 3\), then \(G\) will have the exact same shape as \(F\) (since both share the derivative \(f\)), but \(G\) will be shifted vertically away from the graph of \(F\), as pictured in red in <a knowl="./knowl/F_5.1.Ex1.html" knowl-id="xref-F_5.1.Ex1" alt="Figure 5.1.4 " title="Figure 5.1.4 ">Figure 5.1.4</a>. Note that \(G(1) - G(0) = \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = 0.5\), just as \(F(1) - F(0) = 0.5,\), but since \(G(0) = 3\), \(G(1) = G(0) + 0.5 = 3.5\), whereas \(F(1) = F(0) + 0.5 = 1.5\), since \(F(0) = 1\). In the same way, if we assigned a different initial value to the antiderivative, say \(H(0) = -1\), we would get still another antiderivative, as shown in magenta in <a knowl="./knowl/F_5.1.Ex1.html" knowl-id="xref-F_5.1.Ex1" alt="Figure 5.1.4 " title="Figure 5.1.4 ">Figure 5.1.4</a>.
