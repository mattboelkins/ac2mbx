<li id="li-1511">Letting \(r\) represent the water's radius at time \(t\) and \(h\) the water's depth, we see the following situation:
	<img width="100%" src="images/3_5_Act1Soln.png">
</li>
<li id="li-1512">Observe that the right triangle with legs of length \(h\) and \(r\) is similar to the right triangle with legs of length \(8\) and \(6\), respectively, based on how the water assumes the shape of the tank, and thus \(\frac{r}{h} = \frac{6}{8}\), so that \(r = \frac{3}{4}h\).</li>
<li id="li-1513">Since the water in the tank always takes the shape of a circular cone, the volume of water in the tank at time \(t\) is given by \(V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\).  Because we have established that \(r = \frac{3}{4}h\), it follows that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-361">\[
V = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{3}{4}h \right)^2 h = \frac{3}{16} \pi h^3.
\]</span>
</li>
<li id="li-1514">Differentiating with respect to \(t\), we now find
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-362">\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt},
\]</span>
 
	which relates the rates of change of \(V\) and \(h\).</li>
<li id="li-1515">It is given in the problem setting that water is entering the tank at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute, hence \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\), and we are interested in the rate of change of the water's depth when \(h = 3\).  Substituting these values into the equation that relates \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), we find that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-363">\[
4 =  \frac{1}{16} \pi 3^2 \left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3},
\]</span>
 
	so that \(\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3} = \frac{64}{9\pi} \approx 2.2635\) feet per minute.</li>
