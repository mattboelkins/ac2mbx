If we wish to compute the value of a definite integral using the definition, we have to take the limit of a sum. While this is possible to do in select circumstances, it is also tedious and time-consuming; moreover, computing these limits does not offer much additional insight into the meaning or interpretation of the definite integral. Instead, in <a href="S_4.4.FTC.html" alt="Section 4.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" title="Section 4.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus">Section 4.4</a>, we will learn the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, a result that provides a shortcut for evaluating a large class of definite integrals. This will enable us to determine the exact net signed area bounded by a continuous function and the \(x\)-axis in many circumstances, including examples such as \(\int_1^4 (x^2 + 1) \, dx\), which we approximated by Riemann sums in Preview <a href="S_4.3.DefiniteIntegral.html#PA_4.3" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a>.
