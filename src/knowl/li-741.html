</h5>The value of \(P'(2)\) will tell us the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) at the instant two decades have elapsed.  Observe that \(P'(t) = 8\cos(t)\), and thus \(P'(2) = 8\cos(2) \approx -3.329\) hundred animals per decade.  This tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) on January 1, 2030 is about \(-3329\) animals per decade, which tells us that the animal population is shrinking considerably at this point in time.  We might say that for whatever the population is on January 1, 2030, we expect that population to drop by about 3300 animals over the next ten years, provided the current population trend continues.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2.2.SinCos.html#li-741">in-context</a></span>
