Now, by the first derivative test, to find relative extremes of \(f\) we look for critical numbers at which \(f'\) changes sign. In this example, \(f'\) only changes sign at \(x = 3\), where \(f'\) changes from positive to negative, and thus \(f\) has a relative maximum at \(x = 3\). While \(f\) has a critical number at \(x = -1\), since \(f\) is increasing both before and after \(x = -1\), \(f\) has neither a minimum nor a maximum at \(x = -1\).
