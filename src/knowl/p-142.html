\item The limit definition of the derivative, \(f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\), produces a value for each \(x\) at which the derivative is defined, and this leads to a new function whose formula is \(y = f'(x)\). Hence we talk both about a given function \(f\) and its derivative \(f'\). It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function (\(f\)) and produces a new, related function (\(f'\)).
\item There is essentially no difference between writing \(f'(a)\) (as we did regularly in <a href="S_1.3.DerivativePt.html" alt="Section 1.3 The derivative of a function at a point" title="Section 1.3 The derivative of a function at a point">Section 1.3</a>) and writing \(f'(x)\). In either case, the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.
\item Given the graph of a function \(y = f(x)\), we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative \(y = f'(x)\) by observing that <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">heights</em> on the derivative's graph correspond to <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">slopes</em> on the original function's graph.
\item In <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.4.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.4.1" alt="Exercise 1.4.3 " title="Exercise 1.4.3 ">Activity 1.4.3</a>, we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs, such as the shifted absolute value function. At such points, the derivative fails to exist, and we say that \(f\) is not differentiable there. For now, it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.
