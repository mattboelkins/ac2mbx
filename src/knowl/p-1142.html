In this way, we see that if we are given a function \(f\) for which we can find the exact net-signed area bounded by \(f\) on a given interval, along with one value of a corresponding antiderivative \(F\), we can find any other value of \(F\) that we seek, and in this way construct a completely accurate graph of \(F\). We have two main options for finding the exact net-signed area: using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (which requires us to find an algebraic formula for an antiderivative of the given function \(f\)), or, in the case where \(f\) has nice geometric properties, finding net-signed areas through the use of known area formulas.
