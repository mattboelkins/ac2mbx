</h5>The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, with legs of length \(6\) and \(s\) is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs (length 15) and horizontal leg of length \(x + s\).  Because the ratios of the lengths of the legs of these two triangles is equal, we have
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-378">\[
\frac{s}{6} = \frac{s+x}{15}.
\]</span>
   
	Simplifying, we have \(15s = 6s + 6x\), so that \(9s = 2x\), or most simply, \(3s = 2x\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.5.RelatedRates.html#li-1555">in-context</a></span>
