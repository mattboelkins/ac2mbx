<li id="li-1476">We let \(r\) be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can and \(h\) be its height.</li>
<li id="li-1477">Volume is the area of the base times the height, so \(V = \pi r^2 h\).  Surface area is the area of the lids plus the area of the side, the latter of which is a rectangle with height \(h\) and width the perimeter of the base.  Hence, \(S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h\).  Finally, the total cost is the cost of the lids plus the cost of the sides, which is
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-339">\[
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.015.
\]</span>
</li>
<li id="li-1478">Because the volume is fixed at 16 cubic inches, we know that \(16 =  \pi r^2 h\).  Solving for \(h\), \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\).  Substituting this expression for \(h\) in the formula for total cost, we now have that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-340">\[
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r \left( \frac{16}{\pi r^2} \right) \cdot 0.015 = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r} .
\]</span>
 
	With \(C(r) = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r}\), we note that the only constraint on \(r\) is that \(r &gt; 0\), hence this is the domain on which we seek to minimize \(C\).</li>
<li id="li-1479">Noting that \(C'(r) = 0.108 \pi r - 0.48 \frac{1}{r^2}\), we set \(C'(r) = 0\) and solve for \(r\) to find that 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-341">\[
0.108 \pi r = \frac{0.48}{r^2},
\]</span>
 
	so that \(r^3 = \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} \approx 1.41471\), from which it follows that \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) is the only critical value of \(C\).
	At this point, we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that \(C\) has an absolute minimum at \(r = 1.12259\).  We choose to use the second derivative test; note that \(C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}\), which is always positive for \(r &gt; 0\), hence \(C\) is always concave up on the relevant domain (\(r &gt; 0\)), which makes \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) where the absolute minimum of \(C\) occurs.  In addition, we note that since \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\), the corresponding \(h\) value is \(h \approx 4.041337\), and the overall minimum cost is \(C(1.12259) \approx 0.64137\).</li>
