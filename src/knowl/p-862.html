A television camera is positioned 4000 feet from the base of a rocket launching pad. The angle of elevation of the camera has to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight. In addition, the auto-focus of the camera has to take into account the increasing distance between the camera and the rocket. We assume that the rocket rises vertically. (A similar problem is discussed and pictured dynamically at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9t}{<tt xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/9t</tt>}. Exploring the applet at the link will be helpful to you in answering the questions that follow.)
