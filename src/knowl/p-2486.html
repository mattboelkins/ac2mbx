As Preview <a href="S_8.6.PowerSeries.html#PA_8.6" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a> shows, it can be useful to treat an unknown function as if it has a Taylor series, and then determine the coefficients from other information. In other words, we define a function as an infinite series of powers of \(x\) and then determine the coefficients based on something besides a formula for the function. This method of using series illustrated in Preview <a href="S_8.6.PowerSeries.html#PA_8.6" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a> to solve differential equations is a powerful and important one that allows us to approximate solutions to many different types of differential equations even if we cannot explicitly solve them. This approach is different from defining a Taylor series based on a given function, and these functions we define with arbitrary coefficients are given a special name.
