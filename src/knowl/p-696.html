Next, to apply the first derivative test, we'd like to know the sign of \(f'(x)\) at inputs near the critical numbers. Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which \(f'\) can change sign, it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers: for instance, the sign of \(f'\) must be the same for every \(x \lt  -1\). We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of \(f'\) on the relevant intervals along with the corresponding behavior of \(f\).
