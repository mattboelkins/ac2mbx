</h5>Think about zooming in on the graph at \(t = 2\) and drawing a line that, up close, looks just like the curve \(s(t)\).  What is the approximate slope of that line?  By drawing this line that looks like \(s(t)\) near the point \((2,s(2))\) and comparing the line through the points \((1.5,s(1.5))\) and \((2.5, s(2.5))\), you should be able to compare the lines and see which has greater slope.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.2.Limits.html#li-95">in-context</a></span>
