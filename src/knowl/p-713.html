The point \(A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3})\) is a local maximum, as \(f\) is increasing prior to \(A\) and decreasing after; similarly, the point \(E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})\) is a local minimum. Note, too, that \(f\) is concave down at \(A\) and concave up at \(B\), which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test. At points \(B\) and \(D\), concavity changes, as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.signchart3.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.signchart3" alt="Figure 3.1.10 " title="Figure 3.1.10 ">FigureÂ 3.1.10</a>. Finally, at point \(C\), \(f\) has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line, but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there since \(f\) is decreasing both before and after \(C\). It is also the case that concavity changes at \(C\).
