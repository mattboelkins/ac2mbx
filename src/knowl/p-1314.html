We have seen that the technique of Integration by Parts is well suited to integrating the product of basic functions, and that it allows us to essentially trade a given integrand for a new one where one function in the product is replaced by its derivative, while the other is replaced by its antiderivative. The main goal in this trade of \(\int u \, dv\) for \(\int v \, du\) is to have the new integral not be more challenging to evaluate than the original one. At times, it turns out that it can be necessary to apply Integration by Parts more than once in order to ultimately evaluate a given indefinite integral.
