Each derivative exists and is defined on the same domain as the original function. For example, both the tangent function and its derivative are defined for all real numbers \(x\) such that \(x \ne \frac{k\pi}{2}\), where \(k = \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots\).
\item The above four rules for the derivatives of the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant can be used along with the rules for power functions, exponential functions, and the sine and cosine, as well as the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules, to quickly differentiate a wide range of different functions.
