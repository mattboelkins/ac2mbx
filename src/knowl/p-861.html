Recognizing familiar geometric configurations is one way that we relate the changing quantities in a given problem. For instance, while the problem in <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.5.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.5.1" alt="Exercise 3.5.2 " title="Exercise 3.5.2 ">ActivityÂ 3.5.2</a> is centered on a conical tank, one of the most important observations is that there are two key right triangles present. In another setting, a right triangle might be indicative of an opportunity to take advantage of the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle. But in the conical tank, the fact that the water at any time fills a portion of the tank in such a way that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the most important relationship with which to work. That enables us to write \(r\) in terms of \(h\) and reduce the overall problem to one where the volume of water depends simply on \(h\), and hence to subsequently relate \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt}\). In other situations where a changing angle is involved, a right triangle may offer the opportunity to find relationships among various parts of the triangle using trigonometric functions.
