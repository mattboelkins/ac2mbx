Perhaps the most powerful part of EquationÂ <a knowl="./knowl/E_FTCVel.html" knowl-id="xref-E_FTCVel" alt="Equation 4.4.1 " title="Equation 4.4.1 ">(4.4.1)</a> lies in the fact that we can compute the integral's value if we can find a formula for \(s\). Remember, \(s\) and \(v\) are related by the fact that \(v\) is the derivative of \(s\), or equivalently that \(s\) is an antiderivative of \(v\). For example, if we have an object whose velocity is \(v(t) = 3t^2 + 40\) feet per second (which is always nonnegative), and wish to know the distance traveled on the interval \([1,5]\), we have that
