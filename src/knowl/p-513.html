As we gain more experience with differentiating complicated functions, we will become more comfortable in the process of simply writing down the derivative without taking multiple steps. We demonstrate part of this perspective here by showing how we can find a composite rule that corresponds to two of our basic functions. For instance, we know that \(\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)\). If we instead want to know
