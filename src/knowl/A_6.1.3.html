Each of the following questions somehow involves the arc length along a curve.
</p>
<ol xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-2236">Use the definition and appropriate computational technology to determine the arc length along \(y = x^2\) from \(x = -1\) to \(x = 1\).</li>
<li id="li-2237">Find the arc length of \(y = \sqrt{4-x^2}\) on the interval \(-2 \le x \le 2\).  Find this value in two different ways: (a) by using a definite integral, and (b) by using a familiar property of the curve.</li>
<li id="li-2238">Determine the arc length of \(y = xe^{3x}\) on the interval \([0,1]\).</li>
<li id="li-2239">Will the integrals that arise calculating arc length typically be ones that we can evaluate exactly using the First FTC, or ones that we need to approximate?  Why?</li>
<li id="li-2240">A moving particle is traveling along the curve given by \(y = f(x) = 0.1x^2 + 1\), and does so at a constant rate of 7 cm/sec, where both \(x\) and \(y\) are measured in cm (that is, the curve \(y = f(x)\) is the path along which the object actually travels; the curve is not a “position function”).  Find the position of the particle when \(t = 4\) sec, assuming that when \(t = 0\), the particle's location is \((0,f(0))\).</li>
