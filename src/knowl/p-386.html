As parts (b) and (d) of Preview <a href="S_2.3.ProdQuot.html#PA_2.3" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> show, it is not true in general that the derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the derivatives of those functions. Indeed, the rule for differentiating a function of the form \(p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\) in terms of the derivatives of \(f\) and \(g\) is more complicated than simply taking the product of the derivatives of \(f\) and \(g\). To see further why this is the case, as well as to begin to understand how the product rule actually works, we consider an example involving meaningful functions.
