Here, there is not a composite function present, but rather a product of the basic functions \(f(x) = x\) and \(g(x) = \sin(x)\). From our work in <a href="S_2.3.ProdQuot.html" alt="Section 2.3 The product and quotient rules" title="Section 2.3 The product and quotient rules">SectionÂ 2.3</a> with the Product Rule, we know that it is relatively complicated to compute the derivative of the product of two functions, so we should expect that antidifferentiating a product should be similarly involved. In addition, intuitively we expect that evaluating \(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\) will involve somehow reversing the Product Rule.
