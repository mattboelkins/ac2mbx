Indeed, it can be proved formally that if a function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), then it must be continuous at \(x = a\). So, if \(f\) is not continuous at \(x = a\), then it is automatically the case that \(f\) is not differentiable there. For example, in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.Cont.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.Cont" alt="Figure 1.7.5 " title="Figure 1.7.5 ">FigureÂ 1.7.5</a> from our early discussion of continuity, both \(f\) and \(g\) fail to be differentiable at \(x = 1\) because neither function is continuous at \(x = 1\). But can a function fail to be differentiable at a point where the function is continuous?
