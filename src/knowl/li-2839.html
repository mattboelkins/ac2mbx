</h5>Now we consider larger loans, e.g. automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time.  In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment \(M\) that will take our outstanding principal to \(0\) in the specified amount of time.  To do so, we want to know the value of \(M\) that makes \(P(t) = 0\) in formulaÂ <a knowl="./knowl/eq_loan2.html" knowl-id="xref-eq_loan2" alt="Equation 8.2.9 " title="Equation 8.2.9 ">(8.2.9)</a>.  If we set \(P(t) = 0\) and solve for \(M\), it follows that

<span class="displaymath" id="me-839">\[

M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}.

<li id="li-2840">Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?

We need to find the value of \(M\) in our formula:
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-840">\[
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)} = \frac{(0.0625)(15000)\left(1+\frac{0.0625}{12}\right)^{60}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{0.0625}{12}\right)^{60} - 1 \right)} \approx 291.74.
\]</span><p id="p-2104">
So we need to pay $291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years. During that time we spend a total of \(12 \times 5 \times 291.74 = 17,504.40\) dollars on the loan or $2,504.40 in interest.
