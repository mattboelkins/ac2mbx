\item Suppose you drop a golf ball onto a hard surface from a height \(h\). The collision with the ground causes the ball to lose energy and so it will not bounce back to its original height. The ball will then fall again to the ground, bounce back up, and continue. Assume that at each bounce the ball rises back to a height \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the height from which it dropped. Let \(h_n\) be the height of the ball on the \(n\)th bounce, with \(h_0 = h\). In this exercise we will determine the distance traveled by the ball and the time it takes to travel that distance.
