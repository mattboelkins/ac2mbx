\item Given a differentiable function \(y = f(x)\), we can express the derivative of \(f\) in several different notations: \(f'(x)\), \(\frac{df}{dx}\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), and \(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]\).
\item The limit definition of the derivative leads to patterns among certain families of functions that enable us to compute derivative formulas without resorting directly to the limit definition. For example, if \(f\) is a power function of the form \(f(x) = x^n\), then \(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\) for any real number \(n\) other than 0. This is called the Rule for Power Functions.
\item We have stated a rule for derivatives of exponential functions in the same spirit as the rule for power functions: for any positive real number \(a\), if \(f(x) = a^x\), then \(f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)\).
\item If we are given a constant multiple of a function whose derivative we know, or a sum of functions whose derivatives we know, the Constant Multiple and Sum Rules make it straightforward to compute the derivative of the overall function. More formally, if \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are differentiable with derivatives \(f'(x)\) and \(g'(x)\) and \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, then
