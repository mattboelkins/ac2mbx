<li id="li-653">Note that since \(h(z) = z^{1/2} + z^{-1}\), we have \(h'(z) = \frac{1}{2}z^{-1/2} - z^{-2}\).  Thus, \(h'(4) = \frac{1}{2(4)^{1/2}} - \frac{1}{4^2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16}.\)  Thus, the slope of the tangent line to \(h(z)\) at the point where \(z = 4\) is \(\frac{3}{16}\).</li>
<li id="li-654">For (i.), note that \(P'(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37)\), and therefore \(P'(4) =  2(1.37)^4 \ln(1.37) \approx 2.218\) million cells per day.  For (ii.), we can compute \(P''(t)\) and find that \(P''(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37) \ln(1.37)\) and therefore find that \(P''(4) \approx  0.69825\).  Since \(P''(4)\) is positive, this tells us that the instantaneous rate of change \(P'(t)\) is increasing at \(t = 4\), and thus the population is growing at an increasing rate.</li>
<li id="li-655">Given \(p(a) = 3a^4 - 2a^3 + 7a^2 - a + 12\), first observe that \(p(-1) = 3 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 12 = 25\), so the tangent line will pass through \((-1,25)\).  Further, since \(p'(a) = 12a^3 - 6a^2 + 14a - 1\), we have \(p'(-1) = -12 - 6 - 14 - 1 = -33\), which is the slope of the tangent line.  The equation of the tangent line is therefore \(y - 25 = -33(a+1)\).</li>
<li id="li-656">The biggest difference is that (a) asks for the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>slope</em> of the tangent line, while (c) asks for the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>equation</em> of the tangent line.  The latter requires the slope of the tangent line, but the slope and equation are two different entities.</li>
