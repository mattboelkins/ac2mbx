<li id="li-35">\(AV_{[1.5,2]} = \frac{s(2)-s(1.5)}{2-1.5} = -24\) ft/sec.  We note that this average velocity is negative, and in fact is the opposite of the average velocity of 24 ft/sec on the interval \([0,0.5]\).</li>
<li id="li-36">Since \(AV_{[1.499,1.5]} = -15.984\) and \(AV_{[1.5, 1.501]} = -16.016\), it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 1.5\) is approximately \(-16\) ft/sec.  Similar computations show that at \(t = 2\), it appears the instantaneous velocity is about \(-32\) ft/sec.  Note that \(-16&gt;-32\), so the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 1.5\) is greater because it is “less negative.” Asking which number is “greater” is different from asking which number is “more negative.”</li>
<li id="li-37">When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.</li>
<li id="li-38">Note that \((1,s(1))\) is the vertex of the parabola given by \(s(t)\).  At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling.  On intervals of the form \([a,1]\), where \(a \lt  1\), the average velocity of the ball is positive; on intervals of form \([1,b]\), where \(b &gt; 1\), the average velocity is positive.  Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment \(t = 1\) to be zero.</li>
