it follows that \(F(x) = -\cos(x)\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\). It is equivalent to say that \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) is the derivative of \(F(x) = -\cos(x)\), and thus \(F\) and \(f\) together form the function-derivative pair. Clearly, every basic derivative rule leads us to such a pair, and thus to a known antiderivative. In <a knowl="./knowl/A_4.4.2.html" knowl-id="xref-A_4.4.2" alt="Exercise 4.4.5 " title="Exercise 4.4.5 ">ActivityÂ 4.4.5</a>, we will construct a list of most of the basic antiderivatives we know at this time. Furthermore, those rules will enable us to antidifferentiate sums and constant multiples of basic functions. For example, if \(f(x) = 5\sin(x) - 4x^2\), note that since \(-\cos(x)\) is an antiderivative of \(\sin(x)\) and \(\frac{1}{3}x^3\) is an antiderivative of \(x^2\), it follows that
