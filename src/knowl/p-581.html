In all of our studies with derivatives to date, we have worked in a setting where we can express a formula for the function of interest explicitly in terms of \(x\). But there are many interesting curves that are determined by an equation involving \(x\) and \(y\) for which it is impossible to solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).
