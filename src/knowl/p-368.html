We have now added two additional functions to our library of basic functions whose derivatives we know: power functions, exponential functions, and the sine and cosine functions. The constant multiple and sum rules still hold, of course, and all of the inherent meaning of the derivative persists, regardless of the functions that are used to constitute a given choice of \(f(x)\). The following activity puts our new knowledge of the derivatives of \(\sin(x)\) and \(\cos(x)\) to work.
