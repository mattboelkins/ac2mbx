As we move from an average rate of change to an instantaneous one, we can think of one point as “sliding towards” another. In particular, provided the function has a derivative at \((a,f(a))\), the point \((a+h,f(a+h))\) will approach \((a,f(a))\) as \(h \to 0\). Because this process of taking a limit is a dynamic one, it can be helpful to use computing technology to visualize what the limit is accomplishing.

For applets that have been built in Geogebra, a nice example is the work of Marc Renault of Shippensburg University at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5p}{<tt xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/5p</tt>}, with the example at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5q}{<tt xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/5q</tt>} being especially fitting for our work in this section.  There are scores of other examples posted by other authors on the internet.</span></span>, one of the best is a java applet in which the user is able to control the point that is moving.
