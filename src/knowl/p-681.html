In many different settings, we are interested in knowing where a function achieves its least and greatest values. These can be important in applications – say to identify a point at which maximum profit or minimum cost occurs – or in theory to understand how to characterize the behavior of a function or a family of related functions. Consider the simple and familiar example of a parabolic function such as \(s(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 48\) (shown at left in <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.Intro" alt="Figure 3.1.1 " title="Figure 3.1.1 ">Figure 3.1.1</a>) that represents the height of an object tossed vertically: its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola and represents the highest value that the object reaches. Moreover, this maximum value identifies an especially important point on the graph, the point at which the curve changes from increasing to decreasing.
