In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.4.ffprime.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.4.ffprime" alt="Figure 1.4.1 " title="Figure 1.4.1 ">FigureÂ 1.4.1</a>, on the left we show a plot of \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\) together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we've considered above. On the right, we show a plot of \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\) with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points. Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graph: the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way: <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">the slope of the tangent line</em> at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">height</em> at the corresponding point on the righthand graph. That is, at each respective value of \(x\), the slope of the tangent line to the original function at that \(x\)-value is the same as the height of the derivative function at that \(x\)-value. Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different: in the left graph, the vertical units are simply the output units of \(f\). On the righthand graph of \(y = f'(x)\), the units on the vertical axis are units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\).
