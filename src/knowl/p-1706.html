In previous chapters, we have seen that a function's derivative tells
us the rate at which the function is changing. More recently,
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us to determine
the total change of a function over an interval
when we know the function's rate
of change. For instance, an object's velocity tells us the rate of
change of that object's position. By integrating the velocity over a
time interval, we may determine by how much the position changes over
that time interval. In particular, if we know where the object is at the beginning
of that interval, then we have enough information to accurately
predict where it will be at the end of the interval.
