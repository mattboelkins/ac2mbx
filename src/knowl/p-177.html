and this quantity measures the slope of the secant line to \(y = f(x)\) through the points \((a-h, f(a-h))\) and \((a+h, f(a+h))\). The central difference generates a good approximation of the derivative's value any time we have symmetric data surrounding a point of interest.
\item Knowing the derivative and function values at a single point enables us to estimate other function values nearby. If, for example, we know that \(f'(7) = 2\), then we know that at \(x = 7\), the function \(f\) is increasing at an instantaneous rate of 2 units of output for every one unit of input. Thus, we expect \(f(8)\) to be approximately 2 units greater than \(f(7)\). The value is approximate because we don't know that the rate of change stays the same as \(x\) changes.
