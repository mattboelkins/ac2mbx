In most of our applications of the derivative so far, we have worked in settings where one quantity (often called \(y\)) depends explicitly on another (say \(x\)), and in some way we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which \(y\) changes with respect to \(x\), leading us to compute \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). These settings emphasize how the derivative enables us to quantify how the quantity \(y\) is changing as \(x\) changes at a given \(x\)-value.
