\item When we write \(x \to \infty\), this means that \(x\) is increasing without bound. We thus use \(\infty\) along with limit notation to write \(\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\), which means we can make \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we like by choosing \(x\) to be sufficiently large, and similarly \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\), which means we can make \(f(x)\) as large as we like by choosing \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\).
\item A version of L'Hopital's Rule also allows us to use derivatives to assist us in evaluating indeterminate limits of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). In particular, If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable and both approach zero or both approach \(\pm \infty\) as \(x \to a\) (where \(a\) is allowed to be \(\infty\)), then
