What if we instead consider a thin bar over which density is distributed continuously? If the density is constant, it is obvious that the balancing point of the bar is its midpoint. But if density is not constant, we must compute a weighted average. Let's say that the function \(\rho(x)\) tells us the density distribution along the bar, measured in g/cm. If we slice the bar into small sections, this enables us to think of the bar as holding a collection of adjacent point-masses. For a slice of thickness \(\triangle x\) at location \(x_i\), note that the mass of the slice, \(m_i\), satisfies \(m_i \approx \rho(x_i) \triangle x\).
