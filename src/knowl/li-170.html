</h5>Observe that whenever the ball is rising, it's position function is rising, and thus the slope of its tangent line at any such point will be positive. This means that we should find \(s'(a)\) to be positive whenever \(0 \le a \lt  \frac{1}{2}\), and similarly \(s'(a)\) to be negative whenever \(\frac{1}{2} \lt  a \lt  2\) (which is when the ball is falling).  At the instant \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), the ball is at its vertex and is neither rising nor falling, and at that point, \(s'(\frac{1}{2}) = 0.\)</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_1.3.DerivativePt.html#li-170">in-context</a></span>
