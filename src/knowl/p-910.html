Most of our work in this section has occurred under the assumption that velocity is positive. This hypothesis guarantees that the movement of the object under consideration is always in a single direction, and hence ensures that the moving body's change in position is the same as the distance it travels on a given interval. As we saw in <a knowl="./knowl/A_4.1.2.html" knowl-id="xref-A_4.1.2" alt="Exercise 4.1.7 " title="Exercise 4.1.7 ">ActivityÂ 4.1.7</a>, there are natural settings in which a moving object's velocity is negative; we would like to understand this scenario fully as well.
