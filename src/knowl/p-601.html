<a knowl="./knowl/Ex_2.7.1.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_2.7.1" alt="Example 2.7.3 " title="Example 2.7.3 ">ExampleÂ 2.7.3</a> shows that it is possible when differentiating implicitly to have multiple terms involving \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). Regardless of the particular curve involved, our approach will be similar each time. After differentiating, we expand so that each side of the equation is a sum of terms, some of which involve \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). Next, addition and subtraction are used to get all terms involving \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) on one side of the equation, with all remaining terms on the other. Finally, we factor to get a single instance of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), and then divide to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).
