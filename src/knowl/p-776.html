In <a href="S_3.4.AppliedOpt.html" alt="Section 3.4 Applied Optimization" title="Section 3.4 Applied Optimization">SectionÂ 3.4</a>, we will focus almost exclusively on applied optimization problems: problems where we seek to find the absolute maximum or minimum value of a function that represents some physical situation. We conclude this current section with an example of one such problem because it highlights the role that a closed, bounded domain can play in finding absolute extrema. In addition, these problems often involve considerable preliminary work to develop the function which is to be optimized, and this example demonstrates that process.
