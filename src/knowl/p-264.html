\item A function \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x \to a\) if and only if \(f\) has a left-hand limit at \(x = a\), has a right-hand limit at \(x = a\), and the left- and right-hand limits are equal. Visually, this means that there can be a hole in the graph at \(x = a\), but the function must approach the same single value from either side of \(x = a\).
\item A function \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\) whenever \(f(a)\) is defined, \(f\) has a limit as \(x \to a\), and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree. This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of \(f\) at \(x = a\).
\item A function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\) whenever \(f'(a)\) exists, which means that \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\) and thus \(f\) is locally linear at the value \(x = a\). Informally, this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at \((a,f(a))\) and that there is not a corner point or cusp at \((a,f(a))\).
\item Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at \(x = a\), being continuous at \(x = a\), and being differentiable at \(x = a\)), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), then \(f\) is also continuous at \(x = a\), and if \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\), then \(f\) has a limit at \(x = a\).
