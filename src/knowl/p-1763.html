Remember that a first-order differential equation gives us information
about the derivative of an unknown function.
Since the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the
tangent line at this point, a differential equation
gives us crucial information about the tangent lines to the graph of
a solution. We will use this information about the tangent lines to
create a <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">slope field</em> for the differential equation, which enables
us to sketch solutions to initial value problems. Our aim will be to
understand the solutions qualitatively. That is, we would like to
understand the basic nature of solutions, such as their long-range
behavior, without precisely determining the value of a solution at a
particular point.
