\item To find relative extreme values of a function, we normally use a first derivative sign chart and classify all of the function's critical numbers. If instead we are interested in absolute extreme values, we first decide whether we are considering the entire domain of the function or a particular interval.
\item In the case of finding global extremes over the function's entire domain, we again use a first or second derivative sign chart in an effort to make overall conclusions about whether or not the function can have a absolute maximum or minimum.
If we are working to find absolute extremes on a restricted interval, then we first identify all critical numbers of the function that lie in the interval.
\item For a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, the only possible points at which absolute extreme values occur are the critical numbers and the endpoints. Thus, to find said absolute extremes, we simply evaluate the function at each endpoint and each critical number in the interval, and then we compare the results to decide which is largest (the absolute maximum) and which is smallest (the absolute minimum).
