The observations made in the preceding two paragraphs demonstrate that differentiating and integrating (where we integrate from a constant up to a variable) are almost inverse processes. In one sense, this should not be surprising: integrating involves antidifferentiating, which reverses the process of differentiating. On the other hand, we see that there is some subtlety involved, as integrating the derivative of a function does not quite produce the function itself. This is connected to a key fact we observed in <a href="S_5.1.AntiDGraphs.html" alt="Section 5.1 Constructing Accurate Graphs of Antiderivatives" title="Section 5.1 Constructing Accurate Graphs of Antiderivatives">SectionÂ 5.1</a>, which is that any function has an entire family of antiderivatives, and any two of those antiderivatives differ only by a constant.
