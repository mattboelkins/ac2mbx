As we work more and more with the algebraic structure of functions, it is important to strive to develop a big picture view of what we are doing. Here, we can note several general observations based on the rules we have so far. One is that the derivative of any polynomial function will be another polynomial function, and that the degree of the derivative is one less than the degree of the original function. For instance, if \(p(t) = 7t^5 - 4t^3 + 8t\), \(p\) is a degree 5 polynomial, and its derivative, \(p'(t) = 35t^4 - 12t^2 + 8\), is a degree 4 polynomial. Additionally, the derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function: for example, if \(g(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z\), then \(g'(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z \ln(2)\), which is also exponential.
