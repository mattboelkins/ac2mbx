\begin{exercises}
	\item A sailboat is sitting at rest near its dock. A rope attached to the bow of the boat is drawn in over a pulley that stands on a post on the end of the dock that is 5 feet higher than the bow. If the rope is being pulled in at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the boat approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet?
	
	\item A swimming pool is 60 feet long and 25 feet wide. Its depth varies uniformly from 3 feet at the shallow end to 15 feet at the deep end, as shown in the <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.5.Ez3.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.5.Ez3" alt="Figure 3.5.6 " title="Figure 3.5.6 ">FigureÂ 3.5.6</a>.
