Preview <a href="S_5.1.AntiDGraphs.html#PA_5.1" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">ActivityÂ </a> demonstrates that when we can find the exact area under a given graph on any given interval, it is possible to construct an accurate graph of the given function's antiderivative: that is, we can find a representation of a function whose derivative is the given one. While we have considered this question at different points throughout our study, it is important to note here that we now can determine not only the overall shape of the antiderivative, but also the actual <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">height</em> of the antiderivative at any point of interest.
