leads to interesting patterns and rules that enable us to quickly find a formula for \(f'(x)\) based on the formula for \(f(x)\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">without</em> using the limit definition directly. For example, we already know that if \(f(x) = x\), then it follows that \(f'(x) = 1\). While we could use the limit definition of the derivative to confirm this, we know it to be true because \(f(x)\) is a linear function with slope 1 at every value of \(x\). One of our goals is to be able to take standard functions, say ones such as \(g(x) = 4x^7 - \sin(x) + 3e^x\), and, based on the algebraic form of the function, be able to apply shortcuts to almost immediately determine the formula for \(g'(x)\).
