\item Limits enable us to examine trends in function behavior near a specific point. In particular, taking a limit at a given point asks if the function values nearby tend to approach a particular fixed value.
\item When we write \(\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L\), we read this as saying “the limit of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is \(L\),” and this means that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we want by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to \(a\).
\item If we desire to know \(\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) for a given value of \(a\) and a known function \(f\), we can estimate this value from the graph of \(f\) or by generating a table of function values that result from a sequence of \(x\)-values that are closer and closer to \(a\). If we want the exact value of the limit, we need to work with the function algebraically and see if we can use familiar properties of known, basic functions to understand how different parts of the formula for \(f\) change as \(x \to a\).
\item The instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time is found by taking the limit of average velocities of the object over shorter and shorter time intervals that all contain the time of interest.
