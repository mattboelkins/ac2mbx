In our work to date, we have seen several ways that
differential equations arise in the natural world, from the growth of
a population to the temperature of a cup of coffee. In this section,
we will look more closely at how differential equations give us a
natural way to describe various phenoma. As we'll see, the key is to
focus on understanding the different factors that cause a quantity to
change.
