<span class="solution"><span xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Hint</span> <span class="codenumber">3.4.2.8</span></span>Drop altitudes from the top of the trough to the base of length 2.  In the two triangles that are formed, what are the lengths of the legs in terms of \(\theta\)?  What is the overall area in terms of \(\theta\)?  (Note that since the length of the trough is constant, the volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area.)  Finally, after you differentiate \(A(\theta)\), use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\) to write \(A'(\theta)\) solely in terms of the cosine function and note that the result is a quadratic equation in \(\cos(theta)\).</span><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.4.AppliedOpt.html#hint-118">in-context</a></span>
