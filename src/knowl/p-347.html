Furthermore, while our current emphasis is on learning shortcut rules for finding derivatives without directly using the limit definition, we should be certain not to lose sight of the fact that all of the meaning of the derivative still holds that we developed in <a href="C_1.html" alt="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative" title="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative">Chapter 1</a>. That is, anytime we compute a derivative, that derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the original function, as well as the slope of the tangent line at any selected point on the curve. The following activity asks you to combine the just-developed derivative rules with some key perspectives that we studied in <a href="C_1.html" alt="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative" title="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative">Chapter 1</a>.
