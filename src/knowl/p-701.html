In <a knowl="./knowl/F_3.1.2Dtest.html" knowl-id="xref-F_3.1.2Dtest" alt="Figure 3.1.7 " title="Figure 3.1.7 ">FigureÂ 3.1.7</a>, we see the four possibilities for a function \(f\) that has a critical number \(p\) at which \(f'(p) = 0\), provided \(f''(p)\) is not zero on an interval including \(p\) (except possibly at \(p\)). On either side of the critical number, \(f''\) can be either positive or negative, and hence \(f\) can be either concave up or concave down. In the first two graphs, \(f\) does not change concavity at \(p\), and in those situations, \(f\) has either a local minimum or local maximum. In particular, if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \lt  0\), then we know \(f\) is concave down at \(p\) with a horizontal tangent line, and this guarantees \(f\) has a local maximum there. This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when \(f''(p)\) is positive, is stated in the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">second derivative test</em>.
