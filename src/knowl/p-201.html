In addition to asking <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">whether</em> a function is increasing or decreasing, it is also natural to inquire <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">how</em> a function is increasing or decreasing. To begin, there are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.6.3optsi.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.6.3optsi" alt="Figure 1.6.6 " title="Figure 1.6.6 ">FigureÂ 1.6.6</a>: the function can increase more and more rapidly, increase at the same rate, or increase in a way that is slowing down. Fundamentally, we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends, with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all. More than this, we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.
