</h5>Since \(\ds g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\), we see that \(g'(x) = 0\) implies that \(x = -4\) or \(x = 1\).  While \(x = 2\) makes \(g'\) undefined, we are told that \(g\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\), so \(x = 2\) is not in the domain of \(g\), and hence is technically not a critical value of \(g\).  Nonetheless, we place \(x = 2\) on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which \(g'\) may change sign.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.1.Tests.html#li-1218">in-context</a></span>
