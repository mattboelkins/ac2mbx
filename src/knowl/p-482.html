From one perspective, <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_2.5.Linear.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_2.5.Linear" alt="Example 2.5.1 " title="Example 2.5.1 ">ExampleÂ 2.5.1</a> may be too elementary. Linear functions are the simplest of all functions, and perhaps composing linear functions (which yields another linear function) does not exemplify the true complexity that is involved with differentiating a composition of more complicated functions. At the same time, we should remember the perspective that any differentiable function is <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">locally</em> linear, so any function with a derivative behaves like a line when viewed up close. From this point of view, the fact that the derivatives of \(f\) and \(g\) are multiplied to find the derivative of their composition turns out to be a key insight.
