We also now know that the derivative, \(y = f'(x)\), is itself a function. This means that we can consider taking its derivative – the derivative of the derivative – and therefore ask questions like “what does the derivative of the derivative tell us about how the original function behaves?” As we have done regularly in our work to date, we start with an investigation of a familiar problem in the context of a moving object.
