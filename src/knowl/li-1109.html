</h5>To find where the tangent line to the curve is horizontal, we set \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\), which requires that the numerator be zero, or in other words that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-239">\[
(x-1)(x-2) + x(x-2) + x(x-1) = 0.
\]</span>
 
	Expanding and combining like terms, we find that \(3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\), which occurs where \(x = \frac{3\pm\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 0.42265, 1.57735\). From the graph in <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.7.Act2.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.7.Act2" alt="Figure 2.7.8 " title="Figure 2.7.8 ">FigureÂ 2.7.8</a>, we observe that at each such \(x\)-value, there are several corresponding \(y\)-values for which the tangent line will be horizontal.  For instance, when \(x = 0.42265\), then \(y\) must satisfy the equation
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-240">\[
y(y^2-1)(y-2) = 0.42265(0.42265-1)(0.42265-2) = 0.384900.
\]</span>
 
	Because this is a quartic equation (degree 4) equation in \(y\), we use computational technology to help us find the solutions.  Doing so, we find four approximate values for \(y\), \(y \approx -1.05782, 0.229478, 0.770522, 2.05782\), and thus our estimates for four points at which the tangent line is horizontal are
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-241">\[
(0.42265, -1.05782); (0.42265, 0.229478);  (0.42265, 0.770522); (0.42265, 2.05782).
\]</span>
 
	Similar work can be done to find the four points at which the tangent line is horizontal when \(x \approx 1.57735\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_2.7.Implicit.html#li-1109">in-context</a></span>
