we have now related the rates of change of \(V\), \(h\), and \(r\). If we are given sufficient information, we may then find the value of one or more of these rates of change at one or more points in time. Say, for instance, that we know the following: (a) sand falls from the conveyor in such a way that the height of the pile is always half the radius, and (b) sand falls from the conveyor belt at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute. With this information given, we can answer questions such as: how fast is the height of the sandpile changing at the moment the radius is 4 feet?
