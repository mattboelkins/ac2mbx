We note that \(x = 0\) is not in the domain of \(f\), so we may naturally wonder what happens as \(x \to 0\). As \(x \to 0^+\), we observe that \(f(x)\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">increases without bound</em>. That is, we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as large as we like by taking \(x\) closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, while keeping \(x &gt; 0\). This is a good way to think about what infinity represents: a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.
