We could keep going to determine more and more terms in this Taylor series for \(\theta\), but the point is that we can use series like this one to approximate functions. The difference between this type of problem and our use of Taylor series is that to determine the terms in a Taylor series, we need to know the function from which we derive the series. In this differential equation example, we didn't know the function \(\theta\), be we could calculate terms in a series expansion for \(\theta\) because we had enough information about \(\theta\).
