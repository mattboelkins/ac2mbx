We thus explore the natural idea of allowing the number of rectangles to increase without bound in an effort to compute the exact net signed area bounded by a function on an interval. In addition, it is important to think about the differences among left, right, and middle Riemann sums and the different results they generate as the value of \(n\) increases. As we have done throughout our investigations with area, we begin with functions that are exclusively positive on the interval under consideration.
