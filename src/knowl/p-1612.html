In our work to date with the definite integral, we have seen several different circumstances where the integral enables us to measure the accumulation of a quantity that varies, provided the quantity is approximately constant over small intervals. For instance, based on the fact that the area of a rectangle is \(A = l \cdot w\), if we wish to find the area bounded by a nonnegative curve \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis on an interval \([a,b]\), a representative slice of width \(\triangle x\) has area \(A_{\mbox{{slice}} } = f(x) \triangle x\), and thus as we let the width of the representative slice tend to zero, we find that the exact area of the region is
