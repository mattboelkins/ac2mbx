Researchers at a major car company have found a function that relates gasoline consumption to speed for a particular model of car. In particular, they have determined that the consumption \(C\), in {liters per kilometer}, at a given speed \(s\), is given by a function \(C = f(s)\), where \(s\) is the car's speed in kilometers per hour.

<li id="li-308">Data provided by the car company tells us that \(f(80) = 0.015\), \(f(90) = 0.02\), and \(f(100) = 0.027\).  Use this information to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of fuel consumption with respect to speed at \(s = 90\).  Be as accurate as possible, use proper notation, and include units on your answer.</li>
<li id="li-309">By writing a complete sentence, interpret the meaning (in the context of fuel consumption) of “\(f(80) = 0.015\).”</li>
<li id="li-310">Write at least one complete sentence that interprets the meaning of the value of \(f'(90)\) that you estimated in (a).</li>
