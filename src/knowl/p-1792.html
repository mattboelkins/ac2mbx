In <a href="S_7.2.Qualitative.html" alt="Section 7.2 Qualitative behavior of solutions to DEs" title="Section 7.2 Qualitative behavior of solutions to DEs">SectionÂ 7.2</a>, we saw how a slope field can be used to sketch
solutions to a differential equation. In particular, the slope field
is a plot of a large collection of tangent lines to a large number of solutions of the
differential equation, and we sketch a single solution by simply following
these tangent lines. With a little more thought, we may use this same
idea to numerically approximate the solutions of a differential equation.
