<li id="li-1732">Sketch the region bounded by \(y = 3x\) and the \(x\)-axis on \([0,1]\) and observe that it forms a familiar geometric shape.</li>
<li id="li-1733">Sketch the region bounded by \(y = 2-2x\) and the \(x\)-axis on \([-1,4]\); think carefully about the role of signed area in determining the value of the integral, and subdivide the problem by considering regions on which the curve is positive and negative.</li>
<li id="li-1734">Observe that \(y = \sqrt{1-x^2}\) is the top half the circle whose equation is \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).</li>
<li id="li-1735">Use known formulas for the area of a triangle, square, or circle appropriately.  Keep in mind the role of signed area when dealing with the portions of the region that lie below the \(x\)-axis.</li>
