<li id="li-1472">Note that both the radius and the height of the can are variable.</li>
<li id="li-1473">Remember that volume is the area of the base times the height, while surface are can be thought of in terms of the area of the two lids, plus the area of the “side” of the can.  The side of the can has the shape of a rectangle (think about cutting the cylinder vertically and unrollling it).  The cost of the can is directly related to surface area.  For instance, the cost of the lids is \(2 \cdot 0.027 \cdot\)(area of one lid).</li>
<li id="li-1474">Use the fact that \(V = 16\) to write one of the variables in terms of the other to get the cost as a function of a single variable.</li>
<li id="li-1475">Differentiate the total cost function and find its critical value(s) first.  Use either the first or second derivative test to justify your conclusion.</li>
