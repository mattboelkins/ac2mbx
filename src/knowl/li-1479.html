</h5>Noting that \(C'(r) = 0.108 \pi r - 0.48 \frac{1}{r^2}\), we set \(C'(r) = 0\) and solve for \(r\) to find that

	so that \(r^3 = \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} \approx 1.41471\), from which it follows that \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) is the only critical value of \(C\).
	At this point, we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that \(C\) has an absolute minimum at \(r = 1.12259\).  We choose to use the second derivative test; note that \(C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}\), which is always positive for \(r &gt; 0\), hence \(C\) is always concave up on the relevant domain (\(r &gt; 0\)), which makes \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) where the absolute minimum of \(C\) occurs.  In addition, we note that since \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\), the corresponding \(h\) value is \(h \approx 4.041337\), and the overall minimum cost is \(C(1.12259) \approx 0.64137\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_3.4.AppliedOpt.html#li-1479">in-context</a></span>
