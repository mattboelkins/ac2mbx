Taking a representative slice of the solid located at a value \(x\) that lies between \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2\), we see that the thickness of such a slice is \(\triangle x\) (which is also the height of the cylinder-shaped slice), and that the radius of the slice is determined by the curve \(y = 4-x^2\). Hence, we find that
