The fundamental idea of Preview <a href="S_2.8.LHR.html#PA_2.8" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a> – that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest – can be generalized in a way that enables us to easily evaluate a wide range of limits. We begin by assuming that we have a function \(h(x)\) that can be written in the form \(h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) where \(f\) and \(g\) are both differentiable at \(x=a\) and for which \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\). We are interested in finding a way to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by
\(\ds \lim_{x \to a} h(x).\)
In <a knowl="./knowl/F_2.8.LHR.html" knowl-id="xref-F_2.8.LHR" alt="Figure 2.8.1 " title="Figure 2.8.1 ">Figure 2.8.1</a>, we see a visual representation of the situation involving such functions \(f\) and \(g\). In particular, we see that both \(f\) and \(g\) have an \(x\)-intercept at the point where \(x = a\). In addition, since each function is differentiable, each is locally linear, and we can find their respective tangent line approximations \(L_f\) and \(L_g\) at \(x = a\), which are also shown in the figure. Since we are interested in the limit of \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) as \(x \to a\), the individual behaviors of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) as \(x \to a\) are key to understand. Here, we take advantage of the fact that each function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as \(x \to a\).
