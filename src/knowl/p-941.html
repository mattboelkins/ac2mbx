Of course, finding \(D\) and \(s(b)-s(a)\) for the situation given in <a knowl="./knowl/F_4.2.Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F_4.2.Intro" alt="Figure 4.2.1 " title="Figure 4.2.1 ">Figure 4.2.1</a> presumes that we can actually find the areas represented by \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\). In most of our work in <a href="S_4.1.VelocityDistance.html" alt="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity" title="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity">Section 4.1</a>, such as in <a knowl="./knowl/A_4.1.2.html" knowl-id="xref-A_4.1.2" alt="Exercise 4.1.7 " title="Exercise 4.1.7 ">Activities 4.1.7</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/A_4.1.3.html" knowl-id="xref-A_4.1.3" alt="Exercise 4.1.10 " title="Exercise 4.1.10 ">4.1.10</a>, we worked with velocity functions that were either constant or linear, so that by finding the areas of rectangles and triangles, we could find the area bounded by the velocity function and the horizontal axis exactly. But when the curve that bounds a region is not one for which we have a known formula for area, we are unable to find this area exactly. Indeed, this is one of our biggest goals in <a href="C_4.html" alt="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral" title="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral">Chapter 4</a>: to learn how to find the exact area bounded between a curve and the horizontal axis for as many different types of functions as possible.
