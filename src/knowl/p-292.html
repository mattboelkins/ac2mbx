These stem from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative: either \(f''(a) \lt 0\), \(f''(a) = 0\), or \(f''(a) &gt; 0\). If \(f''(a) &gt; 0\), then we know the graph of \(f\) is concave up, and we see the first possibility on the left, where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve. If \(f''(a) \lt  0\), then we find ourselves in the second situation (from left) where \(f\) is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve. In the situation where \(f''(a) = 0\) and \(f''\) changes sign at \(x = a\), the concavity of the graph will change, and we will see either the third or fourth option<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-9" id="fn-9"><sup xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64"> 2 </sup></a></span><span id="hk-fn-9" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">It is possible to have \(f''(a) = 0\) and have \(f''\) not change sign at \(x = a\), in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options.</span></span>. A fifth option (that is not very interesting) can occur, which is where the function \(f\) is linear, and so \(f(x) = L(x)\) for all values of \(x\).
