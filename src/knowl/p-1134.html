We returned to this question in even more detail in <a href="S_4.1.VelocityDistance.html" alt="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity" title="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity">Section 4.1</a>; there, we considered the situation where we knew the instantaneous velocity of a moving object and worked from that information to determine as much information as possible about the object's position function. We found key connections between the net-signed area under the velocity function and the corresponding change in position of the function; in <a href="S_4.4.FTC.html" alt="Section 4.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" title="Section 4.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus">Section 4.4</a>, the Total Change Theorem further illuminated these connections between \(f'\) and \(f\) in a more general setting, such as the one found in <a knowl="./knowl/F_4.4.TCT.html" knowl-id="xref-F_4.4.TCT" alt="Figure 4.4.7 " title="Figure 4.4.7 ">Figure 4.4.7</a>, showing that the total change in the value of \(f\) over an interval \([a,b]\) is determined by the exact net-signed area bounded by \(f'\) and the \(x\)-axis on the same interval.
