Now, recall the opening example of this section: we began with the function \(y = f(x) = 4x - x^2\) and used the limit definition of the derivative to show that \(f'(a) = 4 - 2a\), or equivalently that \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\). We subsequently graphed the functions \(f\) and \(f'\) as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.4.ffprime.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.4.ffprime" alt="Figure 1.4.1 " title="Figure 1.4.1 ">Figure 1.4.1</a>. Following <a knowl="./knowl/A_1.4.1.html" knowl-id="xref-A_1.4.1" alt="Exercise 1.4.3 " title="Exercise 1.4.3 ">Activity 1.4.3</a>, we now understand that we could have constructed a fairly accurate graph of \(f'(x)\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">without</em> knowing a formula for either \(f\) or \(f'\). At the same time, it is ideal to know a formula for the derivative function whenever it is possible to find one.
