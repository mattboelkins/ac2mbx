Because \(f'\) is itself a function, it is perfectly feasible for us to consider the derivative of the derivative, which is the new function \(y = [f'(x)]'\). We call this resulting function <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">the second derivative</em>\knownindex{\lt main&gt;second derivative\lt /main&gt;} of \(y = f(x)\), and denote the second derivative by \(y = f''(x)\).
Due to the presence of multiple possible derivatives, we will sometimes call \(f'\) “the first derivative” of \(f\), rather than simply “the derivative” of \(f\). Formally, the second derivative is defined by the limit definition of the derivative of the first derivative:
