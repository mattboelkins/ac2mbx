In <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.3.SeqToTanSeq.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.3.SeqToTanSeq" alt="Figure 1.3.4 " title="Figure 1.3.4 ">FigureÂ 1.3.4</a>, we provide a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((a+h,f(a+h))\) that are generated by different values of \(h\). These lines (shown in the first three figures in magenta), are often called <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">secant lines</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;secant line\lt /main&gt;} to the curve \(y = f(x)\). A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points that lie on the curve. For each such line, the slope of the secant line is \(m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\), where the value of \(h\) depends on the location of the point we choose. We can see in the diagram how, as \(h \to 0\), the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point \((a,f(a))\). In the situation where the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists, we say that the resulting value is the slope of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">tangent line</em> to the curve. This tangent line\knownindex{\lt main&gt;tangent line\lt /main&gt;} (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\) is the line through \((a,f(a))\) whose slope is \(m = f'(a)\).
