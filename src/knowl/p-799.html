Near the conclusion of <a href="S_3.3.Optimization.html" alt="Section 3.3 Global Optimization" title="Section 3.3 Global Optimization">Section 3.3</a>, we considered two examples of optimization problems where determining the function to be optimized was part of a broader question. In <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_3.3.1.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_3.3.1" alt="Example 3.3.5 " title="Example 3.3.5 ">Example 3.3.5</a>, we sought to use a single piece of wire to build two geometric figures (an equilateral triangle and square) and to understand how various choices for how to cut the wire led to different values of the area enclosed. One of our conclusions was that in order to maximize the total combined area enclosed by the triangle and square, all of the wire must be used to make a square. In the subsequent <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.3.3.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.3.3" alt="Exercise 3.3.8 " title="Exercise 3.3.8 ">Activity 3.3.8</a>, we investigated how the volume of a box constructed from a piece of cardboard by removing squares from each corner and folding up the sides depends on the size of the squares removed.
