<li id="li-1962">Review the statement of the Second FTC above; what does that theorem tell you about \(A'\)?</li>
<li id="li-1963">Note that \(A(1)= \int_2^1 f(t) \, dt\); don't forget that \(\int_2^1 f(t) \, dt = -\int_1^2 f(t) \, dt\).</li>
<li id="li-1964">Don't miss our key conclusion from (a), which enables us to gain information from the derivative of \(A\) about where \(A\) is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down.</li>
<li id="li-1965">Compare the values of \(A(1)\) and \(F(1)\); note that \(F\) could be equivalently defined by the rule \(F(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt - 1\).</li>
<li id="li-1966">What does the Second FTC tell us about the relationship between \(B\) and \(f\)?  Between \(C\) and \(f\)?  Note, too, that we can write \(B(x) = F(x) - F(3)\), where \(F\) is any antiderivative of \(f\).</li>
