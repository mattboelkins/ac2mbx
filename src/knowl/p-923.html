Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity \(v\) (in meters per second) at time \(t\) (in seconds) given by the piecewise linear function whose graph is pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F_4.1.Act3.html" knowl-id="xref-F_4.1.Act3" alt="Figure 4.1.11 " title="Figure 4.1.11 ">FigureÂ 4.1.11</a>. We view movement to the right as being in the positive direction (with positive velocity), while movement to the left is in the negative direction.
