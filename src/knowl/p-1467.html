Finally, whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves (as in <a knowl="./knowl/E_DiffOfInt.html" knowl-id="xref-E_DiffOfInt" alt="Equation 6.1.1 " title="Equation 6.1.1 ">(6.1.1)</a>) or as the limit of a Riemann sum that adds the areas of thin rectangles between the curves (as in <a knowl="./knowl/E_IntOfDiff.html" knowl-id="xref-E_IntOfDiff" alt="Equation 6.1.2 " title="Equation 6.1.2 ">(6.1.2)</a>), these two results are the same, since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference:
