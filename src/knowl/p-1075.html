Now, in the general setting of wanting to evaluate the definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) for an arbitrary continuous function \(f\), we could certainly think of \(f\) as representing the velocity of some moving object, and \(x\) as the variable that represents time. And again, Equations <a knowl="./knowl/E_FTCVel.html" knowl-id="xref-E_FTCVel" alt="Equation 4.4.1 " title="Equation 4.4.1 ">(4.4.1)</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/E_FTCV.html" knowl-id="xref-E_FTCV" alt="Equation 4.4.2 " title="Equation 4.4.2 ">(4.4.2)</a> hold for any continuous velocity function, even when \(v\) is sometimes negative. This leads us to see that Equation <a knowl="./knowl/E_FTCV.html" knowl-id="xref-E_FTCV" alt="Equation 4.4.2 " title="Equation 4.4.2 ">(4.4.2)</a> tells us something even more important than the change in position of a moving object: it offers a shortcut route to evaluating any definite integral, provided that we can find an antiderivative of the integrand. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) \knownindex{\lt main&gt;FTC\lt /main&gt;} summarizes these observations.
