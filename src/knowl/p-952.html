When a moving body has a positive velocity function \(y = v(t)\) on a given interval \([a,b]\), we know that the area under the curve over the interval is the total distance the body travels on \([a,b]\). While this is the fundamental motivating force behind our interest in the area bounded by a function, we are also interested more generally in being able to find the exact area bounded by \(y = f(x)\) on an interval \([a,b]\), regardless of the meaning or context of the function \(f\). For now, we continue to focus on determining an accurate estimate of this area through the use of a sum of the areas of rectangles, doing so in the setting where \(f(x) \ge 0\) on \([a,b]\). Throughout, unless otherwise indicated, we also assume that \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\).
