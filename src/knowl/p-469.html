In addition to learning how to differentiate a variety of basic functions, we have also been developing our ability to understand how to use rules to differentiate certain algebraic combinations of them. For example, we not only know how to take the derivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) and \(g(x) = x^2\), but now we can quickly find the derivative of each of the following combinations of \(f\) and \(g\):
