In <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html" alt="Section 1.2 The notion of limit" title="Section 1.2 The notion of limit">SectionÂ 1.2</a>, we learned about how the concept of limits can be used to study the trend of a function near a fixed input value. As we study such trends, we are fundamentally interested in knowing how well-behaved the function is at the given point, say \(x = a\). In this present section, we aim to expand our perspective and develop language and understanding to quantify how the function acts and how its value changes near a particular point. Beyond thinking about whether or not the function has a limit \(L\) at \(x = a\), we will also consider the value of the function \(f(a)\) and how this value is related to \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\), as well as whether or not the function has a derivative \(f'(a)\) at the point of interest. Throughout, we will build on and formalize ideas that we have encountered in several settings.
