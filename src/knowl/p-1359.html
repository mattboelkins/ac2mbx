Calculus has a long history, with key ideas going back as far as Greek mathematicians in 400-300 BC. Its main foundations were first investigated and understood independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 1600s, making the modern ideas of calculus well over 300 years old. It is instructive to realize that until the late 1980s, the personal computer essentially did not exist, so calculus (and other mathematics) had to be done by hand for roughly 300 years. During the last 30 years, however, computers have revolutionized many aspects of the world we live in, including mathematics. In this section we take a short historical tour to precede the following discussion of the role computer algebra systems can play in evaluating indefinite integrals. In particular, we consider a class of integrals involving certain radical expressions that, until the advent of computer algebra systems, were often evaluated using an integral table.
