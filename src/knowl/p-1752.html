\item A differential equation is simply an equation that describes the
derivative(s) of an unknown function.
\item Physical principles, as well as some everyday situations, often
describe how a quantity changes, which
lead to differential equations.
\item A solution to a differential equation is a function whose
derivatives satisfy the equation's description. Differential
equations typically have infinitely many solutions,
parametrized by the initial values.
