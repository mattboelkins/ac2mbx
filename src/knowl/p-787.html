A piece of cardboard that is \(10 \times 15\) (each measured in inches) is being made into a box without a top. To do so,
squares are cut from each corner of the box and the remaining sides are folded up. If the box needs to be at least 1 inch deep and no more than 3 inches deep, what is the maximum possible volume of the box? what is the minimum volume? Justify your answers using calculus.
