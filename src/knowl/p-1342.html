In the preceding sections, we have learned two very specific antidifferentiation techniques: \(u\)-substitution and integration by parts. The former is used to reverse the chain rule, while the latter to reverse the product rule. But we have seen that each only works in very specialized circumstances. For example, while \(\int xe^{x^2} \, dx\) may be evaluated by \(u\)-substitution and \(\int x e^x \, dx\) by integration by parts, neither method provides a route to evaluate \(\int e^{x^2} \, dx\). That fact is not a particular shortcoming of these two antidifferentiation techniques, as it turns out there does not exist an elementary algebraic antiderivative for \(e^{x^2}\). Said differently, no matter what antidifferentiation methods we could develop and learn to execute, none of them will be able to provide us with a simple formula that does not involve integrals for a function \(F(x)\) that satisfies \(F'(x) = e^{x^2}\).
