For any function \(f\), there are typically three ways to answer the question “does \(f\) have a limit at \(x = a\), and if so, what is the limit?” The first is to reason graphically as we have just done with the example from Preview <a href="S_1.2.Limits.html#PA_1.2" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a>. If we have a formula for \(f(x)\), there are two additional possibilities: (1) evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach \(a\) on either side, typically using some sort of computing technology, and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value; (2) use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output as the input values approach \(a\). The first approach only produces an approximation of the value of the limit, while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly. The following example demonstrates both of these approaches, while also using the graphs of the respective functions to help confirm our conclusions.
