Note that \(f(1)\) is not defined, which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of \(f\) at \(a = 1\). We will naturally say that \(f\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">not continuous at \(a = 1\)</em>. For the next function \(g\) in in <a knowl="./knowl/F_1.7.Cont.html" knowl-id="xref-F_1.7.Cont" alt="Figure 1.7.5 " title="Figure 1.7.5 ">FigureÂ 1.7.5</a>, we observe that while \(\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 3\), the value of \(g(1) = 2\), and thus the limit does not equal the function value. Here, too, we will say that \(g\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">not continuous</em>, even though the function is defined at \(a = 1\). Finally, the function \(h\) appears to be the most well-behaved of all three, since at \(a = 1\) its limit and its function value agree. That is,
