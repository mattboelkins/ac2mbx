Finally, before proceeding to build a list of common functions whose antiderivatives we know, we revisit the fact that each function has more than one antiderivative. Because the derivative of any constant is zero, any time we seek an arbitrary antiderivative, we may add a constant of our choice. For instance, if we want to determine an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x^2\), we know that \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3\) is one such function. But we could alternately have chosen \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + 7\), since in this case as well, \(G'(x) = x^2\). In some contexts later on in calculus, it is important to discuss the most general antiderivative of a function. If \(g(x) = x^2\), we say that the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">general antiderivative</em> \knownindex{\lt main&gt;antiderivative\lt /main&gt;\lt sub&gt;general\lt /sub&gt;} of \(g\) is
