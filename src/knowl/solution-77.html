<li id="li-1967">By the Second FTC, \(A'(x) = f(x)\).</li>
<li id="li-1968">Since \(A(1)= \int_2^1 f(t) \, dt = -\int_1^2 f(t) \, dt\), it follows \(A(1) = -\frac{\pi}{4}\).</li>
<li id="li-1969">Note that \(A\) is increasing wherever \(f\) is positive, and \(A\) is CCU wherever \(f\) is increasing.  Similar conclusions follow for \(A\) being decreasing and/or concave down.  Moreover, \(A(2) = 0\), \(A(3) = -0.5\), \(A(4) = -1.5\), \(A(5) = -2\), \(A(6) = -2 + \frac{\pi}{4}\), and \(A(7) = -2 + \frac{\pi}{2}\).</li>
<li id="li-1970">In our current example, \(A\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) that satisfies \(A(0) = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}\).  Our earlier work with \(F\) showed that \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(F\) that satisfied \(F(0) = -1\).  Since \(F\) and \(A\) are both antiderivatives of \(f\), they differ by a constant, and that constant is \(-1 - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\).</li>
<li id="li-1971">The Second FTC tells us that \(B' = f\) and \(C' = f\).  Thus, \(B\) and \(C\) are each antiderivatives of \(f\), have the same shape as \(A\) and \(F\), and each differ from \(A\) by just a constant.  Observing that \(B(3) = 0\) and \(C(1) = 0\) enables us to easily sketch these shifted versions of \(A\).</li>
