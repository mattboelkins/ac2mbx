Near the conclusion of <a href="S_3.3.Optimization.html" alt="Section 3.3 Global Optimization" title="Section 3.3 Global Optimization">Section 3.3</a>, we considered two examples of optimization problems where determining the function to be optimized was part of a broader question. In <a knowl="./knowl/Ex_3.3.1.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex_3.3.1" alt="Example 3.3.5 " title="Example 3.3.5 ">Example 3.3.5</a>, we sought to use a single piece of wire to build two geometric figures (an equilateral triangle and square) and to understand how various choices for how to cut the wire led to different values of the area enclosed. One of our conclusions was that in order to maximize the total combined area enclosed by the triangle and square, all of the wire must be used to make a square. In the subsequent <a knowl="./knowl/A_3.3.3.html" knowl-id="xref-A_3.3.3" alt="Exercise 3.3.8 " title="Exercise 3.3.8 ">Activity 3.3.8</a>, we investigated how the volume of a box constructed from a piece of cardboard by removing squares from each corner and folding up the sides depends on the size of the squares removed.
</p>
<p id="p-800">
Both of these problems exemplify situations where there is not a function explicitly provided to optimize. Rather, we first worked to understand the given information in the problem, drawing a figure and introducing variables, and then sought to develop a formula for a function that models the quantity (area or volume, in the two examples, respectively) to be optimized. Once the function was established, we then considered what domain was appropriate on which to pursue the desired absolute minimum or maximum (or both). At this point in the problem, we are finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine and justify the absolute minimum or maximum. Thus, what is primarily different about problems of this type is that the problem-solver must do considerable work to introduce variables and develop the correct function and domain to represent the described situation.

Throughout what follows in the current section, the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems. Initially, some substantial guidance is provided, with the problems progressing to require greater independence as we move along.

According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by “girth” we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. What is the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail? What are the dimensions of the package of largest volume?

Many of the steps in Preview <a href="S_3.4.AppliedOpt.html#PA_3.4" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a> are ones that we will execute in any applied optimization problem. We briefly summarize those here to provide an overview of our approach in subsequent questions.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-1458">Draw a picture and introduce variables.  It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables.  Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step.  Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation.  A nice example of this can be seen at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/99}{<tt class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/99</tt>}, where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.</li>
<li id="li-1459">Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities.  Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced: one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought, and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.</li>
<li id="li-1460">Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized; this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula.  For example, in Preview <a href="S_3.4.AppliedOpt.html#PA_3.4" alt="Paragraphs  Preview Activity" title="Paragraphs  Preview Activity">Activity </a>, we initially found that \(V = x^2 y\), but then the additional relationship that \(4x + y = 108\) (girth plus length equals 108 inches) allows us to relate \(x\) and \(y\) and thus observe equivalently that \(y = 108-4x\).  Substituting for \(y\) in the volume equation yields \(V(x) = x^2(108-4x)\), and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable \(x\).</li>
<li id="li-1461">Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.  Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on.  Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.</li>
<li id="li-1462">Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.  This always involves finding the critical values of the function first.  Then, depending on the domain, we either construct a first derivative sign chart (for an open or unbounded interval) or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical values (for a closed, bounded interval), using ideas we've studied so far in <a href="C_3.html" alt="Chapter 3 Using Derivatives" title="Chapter 3 Using Derivatives">Chapter 3</a>.</li>
<li id="li-1463">Finally, we make certain we have answered the question:  does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity, or the values of the variables that produce the maximum?  That is, finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.</li>

<li id="li-1476">We let \(r\) be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can and \(h\) be its height.</li>
<li id="li-1477">Volume is the area of the base times the height, so \(V = \pi r^2 h\).  Surface area is the area of the lids plus the area of the side, the latter of which is a rectangle with height \(h\) and width the perimeter of the base.  Hence, \(S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h\).  Finally, the total cost is the cost of the lids plus the cost of the sides, which is
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-339">\[
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.015.
\]</span>
</li>
<li id="li-1478">Because the volume is fixed at 16 cubic inches, we know that \(16 =  \pi r^2 h\).  Solving for \(h\), \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\).  Substituting this expression for \(h\) in the formula for total cost, we now have that
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-340">\[
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r \left( \frac{16}{\pi r^2} \right) \cdot 0.015 = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r} .
\]</span>
 
	With \(C(r) = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r}\), we note that the only constraint on \(r\) is that \(r &gt; 0\), hence this is the domain on which we seek to minimize \(C\).</li>
<li id="li-1479">Noting that \(C'(r) = 0.108 \pi r - 0.48 \frac{1}{r^2}\), we set \(C'(r) = 0\) and solve for \(r\) to find that 
	
<span class="displaymath" id="me-341">\[
0.108 \pi r = \frac{0.48}{r^2},
\]</span>
 
	so that \(r^3 = \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} \approx 1.41471\), from which it follows that \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) is the only critical value of \(C\).
	At this point, we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that \(C\) has an absolute minimum at \(r = 1.12259\).  We choose to use the second derivative test; note that \(C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}\), which is always positive for \(r &gt; 0\), hence \(C\) is always concave up on the relevant domain (\(r &gt; 0\)), which makes \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) where the absolute minimum of \(C\) occurs.  In addition, we note that since \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\), the corresponding \(h\) value is \(h \approx 4.041337\), and the overall minimum cost is \(C(1.12259) \approx 0.64137\).</li>

We begin by letting \(x\) be the distance from \(Z\) to \(Q\). Since it is 3 km from \(P\) to \(Q\), the distance from \(P\) to \(Z\) is \(3-x\). Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from \(Z\) to the cabin is \(\sqrt{4+x^2}\).
</p>
<p id="p-808">
Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of \(x\). Because distance equals rate times time, time is thus distance divided by rate. Along the road, the hiker's distance is \(3-x\) km and her rate is \(8\) km/hr, thus her time on the road, \(T_r\) is
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-342">\[
T_r = \frac{3-x}{8}.
\]</span><p id="p-809">
Once she enters the woods, her rate drops to \(3\) km/hr and travels a distance of \(\sqrt{4+x^2}\) km, making her time in the woods, \(T_w\), given by
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-343">\[
T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}.
\]</span><p id="p-810">
Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-344">\[
T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}.
\]</span><p id="p-811">
Because the only values of \(x\) that make sense to use are \(0 \le x \le 3\) (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip), we use this domain for \(T\) and now seek the absolute minimum of \(T\) on \([0,3]\). First, we find that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-345">\[
T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4+x^2)^{-1/2} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}.
\]</span><p id="p-812">
Setting \(T'(x) = 0\) and solving for \(x\), we have \(\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}\), so \(8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}\). Squaring both sides, \(64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2\). Hence, \(55x^2 = 36\), so \(x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.80904\). (We don't consider the critical value \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}\) because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of \(T\).)
</p>
<p id="p-813">
Finally, we evaluate \(T\) at the only critical value in the interval and at the interval's endpoints. Doing so, we find \(T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417\), \(T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}{3}} \approx 1.20185\), and \(T(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.99302\), and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is \(0.99302\) hours, which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from \(P\) to \(Q\) and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.

In more geometric problems, we often use curves or functions to provide natural constraints. For instance, we could investigate which isosceles triangle that circumscribes a unit circle has the smallest area, which you can explore for yourself at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9b}{<tt class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/9b</tt>}. Or similarly, for a region bounded by a parabola, we might seek the rectangle of largest area that fits beneath the curve, as shown at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9c}{<tt class="code-inline">http://gvsu.edu/s/9c</tt>}.

Based on the region, the only possible values of \(x\) are for \(0 \le x \le 5\); moreover, it is evident that for either \(x = 0\) or \(x = 5\), the area of the corresponding rectangle is zero, which can't be where the maximum occurs. Differentiating,

Finally, after you differentiate \(A(\theta)\), use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\) to write \(A'(\theta)\) solely in terms of the cosine function and note that the result is a quadratic equation in \(\cos(theta)\).</span></span><span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-solution-58" id="solution-58"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Solution</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-solution-58" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><p id="p-824">
Once we choose the angle \(\theta\), the two right triangles in the trapezoid are determined, and each has a horizontal leg of length \(\cos(\theta)\) and a vertical leg of length \(\sin(\theta)\). Thus, the sum of the areas of the two triangles is \(\sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), and the area of the rectangle between them is \(2\sin(theta)\). Hence, the area of the trapezoidal cross-section is \(A(\theta) = \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) + 2 \sin(\theta)\). Because the length of the trough is constant, the trough's volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area. Note, too, that the domain for \(\theta\) is \(0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}\).
</p>
<p id="p-825">
Differentiating, we find that
</p>
<span class="displaymath" id="me-350">\[
A'(\theta) = \sin(\theta) (-\sin(\theta)) + \cos(\theta) \cos(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) = -\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta).

Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\), it follows that

<span class="displaymath" id="me-351">\[
A'(\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - 1 + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) = 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) - 1.
\]</span><p id="p-827">
This most recent equation is quadratic in \(\cos(\theta)\), so letting \(u = \cos(\theta)\), we can start to solve the equation \(A'(\theta) = 0\) by solving \(2u^2 + 2u - 1 = 0\). Doing so, we find that

u = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.3660254, -1.3660254,

so only \(u = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\) will be a potential value of the cosine function from an angle that lies in the interval \([0,\frac{\pi}{2}]\). Now, recalling that \(\cos(\theta) = u\), to find the critical value \(\theta\), we solve \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\), which implies \(\theta = \arccos(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}) \approx 1.19606\) radians, or \(\theta \approx 68.5292^\circ\).

<p id="p-829">
Finally, to confirm that \(A\) has an absolute maximum at \(\theta = \arccos(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}) \approx 1.19606\), we consider this value as well as the endpoints of \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\), and evaluate \(A\) to find that \(A(0) = 0\), \(A(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 2\), and \(A(1.19606) \approx 2.2018\), which is the absolute maximum possible cross-sectional area.
