\begin{pa} \label{PA:2.5}
For each function given below, identify its fundamental algebraic structure.  In particular, is the given function a sum, product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?  If the function is a composition of basic functions, state a formula for the inner function $g$ and the outer function $f$ so that the overall composite function can be written in the form $f(g(x))$.  If the function is a sum, product, or quotient of basic functions, use the appropriate rule to determine its derivative.

	\item $p(x) = 2^x \tan(x)$
	\item $r(x) = (\tan(x))^2$
	\item $m(x) = e^{\tan(x)}$
	\item $w(x) = \sqrt{x} + \tan(x)$
	\item $z(x) = \sqrt{\tan(x)}$
